About the Global Findex Database
Financial inclusion is a cornerstone of development, and since 2011, the Global
Findex Database has been the definitive source of data on the ways adults around
the world use financial services, from payments to saving and borrowing, and
manage financial events such as major expenses or losses of income. Results from
the first survey were published in 2011 and have been followed by subsequent
survey results from 2014, 2017, and 2021.
The 2025 version, based on nationally representative surveys of about 145,000
adults in 141 economies and conducted over the calendar year 2024, includes
updated indicators on access to and use of formal and informal financial services
to save, borrow, make payments, and manage financial risk, as well as globally
comparable data on ownership of mobile phones, internet use, and digital safety.
The data also identify gaps in access to and use of digital and financial services by
women and poor adults.
The survey results reflect a snapshot in time based on questions that respondents
answered about their habits and experiences during the 12 months preceding the
survey. Comparing results from the current survey with those from the 2011, 2014,
2017, and 2021 surveys reveals which trends endure, expand, and grow over time.
The Global Findex Database has become a mainstay of global efforts to promote
financial inclusion. In addition to being widely cited by policy makers, researchers,
and development practitioners, Global Findex data are used to track progress
toward the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.
The database, the full text of the accompanying report, and the economy-level
data underlying all figures, along with the questionnaire, the survey methodology,
and other relevant materials, are available on the Global Findex website at
http://globalfindex.worldbank.org.

Mobile phones and the internet are revolutionizing financial inclusion, enabling more
people to access and use digital financial services to manage their financial lives.
From mobile money accounts accessible on basic phones to bank-account-linked
wallets used on smartphones, digital services are fulfilling their promise of being
more accessible and affordable than alternatives that are not digitally accessible,
bringing benefits such as the ability to make daily savings deposits using local agents,
to manage loan disbursements and repayments using an app, and to purchase
pay-as-you-go renewable electricity directly from a phone, to name just a few.
These increases in access to and use of financial accounts enabled by mobile
technology are among the top findings from this fifth edition of the Global Findex,
including new data on ownership of mobile phones and internet use from the
inaugural Global Findex Digital Connectivity Tracker. The data show high levels of
phone ownership and internet use and increased ownership and usage of mobile-
enabled accounts in every region of the world. Mobile platforms in particular have
given millions of people, including those who were previously too difficult or too
expensive to reach, access to financial services, dramatically boosting not just
account ownership but also formal saving and digital payments, while in addition
enabling a range of nonfinancial digital activities.
The report’s main findings are captured in the following sections.
Worldwide, 79 percent of adults have an account at a bank or similar
financial institution, with a mobile money provider, or both, up from
74 percent in 2021
Ownership of financial accounts increased globally by 5 percentage points between
2021 and 2024 and by 6 percentage points in low- and middle-income economies,
in which 75 percent of adults now have an account.
Account owners increasingly use their mobile phones or debit or credit cards
connected to their accounts to make transactions. More than half of all accounts in
low- and middle-income economies are digitally enabled in this way,1 including both

mobile money accounts2 and accounts at banks or similar financial institutions
such as credit unions, cooperatives, microfinance institutions, or post offices.3
Mobile money accounts are driving the increase in account ownership. The growth
over the past 10 years in the share of adults who own any kind of account is
equivalent to the increase in the share of people owning either only a mobile money
account or a mobile money account along with an account at a bank or similar
financial institution (refer to figure ES.1).
Telecommunications companies in Sub-Saharan Africa catalyzed the mobile
money revolution by offering simple transactional accounts via mobile phones.
These companies often operate independently of traditional banks. Though they
emerged in East Africa, they have since spread across the continent and are the
dominant financial providers in some of the region’s economies, supporting a
range of financial activities, including making and receiving payments, saving, and
borrowing.
Even as mobile money continues as a Sub-Saharan African success story, other
regions are reaping the benefits, too. In Latin America and the Caribbean,
adoption of mobile money, typically used in combination with or to digitally enable
accounts at banks and similar financial institutions, is approaching levels seen
in Sub-Saharan Africa. Some economies across Europe and Central Asia are also

narrowing gaps in financial inclusion by embracing mobile money or other digitally
enabled accounts.
To quantify this growth: 40 percent of adults in Sub-Saharan Africa had a mobile money
account as of 2024, up from 27 percent in 2021. In Latin America and the Caribbean,
37 percent of adults had a mobile money account as of 2024, up from 22 percent in 2021.
Worldwide, 86 percent of adults own a mobile phone
Most adults with a mobile phone own a smartphone, though basic phones, which
do not enable internet access, still play an important role providing more affordable
connectivity in the Middle East and North Africa, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa
(refer to figure ES.2).
Expanding the prevalence of smartphones is nonetheless important for increasing
access to economic opportunities and more robust financial services, as these
devices are the primary means by which people in low- and middle-income
economies access the internet. Nearly all adults who use the internet, about
70 percent of the global population, use a smartphone to get online.

Executive summary xxiii
Given that, expanding smartphone ownership could likewise make digital activities
more accessible to a larger share of adults. Social media is the most popular digital
activity: 45 percent of all adults and about 80 percent of internet users engage
in it. The popularity of social media is important not just for allowing people to
communicate and stay connected but also because digital marketplaces are offering
merchants in low- and middle-income economies opportunities to reach new
customers through their social media accounts. These merchants may include the
6 percent of adults who use the internet to make money, including the more than
10 percent of adults who do so in all economies in East Asia and Pacific, the region
with the highest smartphone penetration, second-highest rate of internet usage,
and highest rate of adoption of digital merchant payments.
Gender gaps in account ownership have narrowed, and gender gaps in
mobile phone ownership are small
As overall account ownership has increased, a larger share of women are gaining
access to their own financial accounts. As of 2024, 73 percent of women in low-
and middle-income economies had accounts, up from just 50 percent in 2014 and
66 percent in 2021. East Asia and Pacific continues to stand out, with no statistically
significant difference between the share of women in that region who have an
account and the share of men who do. Similarly, women and men in India are
equally likely to have accounts.
Though meaningful gender gaps in account ownership persist in 65 low- and
middle-income economies, these gaps are narrowing in almost all of them.
The gender gap is now 4 percentage points globally and 5 percentage points in
low- and middle-income economies.
Mobile phone ownership among women likely contributes to the narrowing gender
gaps in account ownership. Although women are 9 percentage points less likely
than men to own a mobile phone in low- and middle-income economies, this
difference is largely driven by the ownership rates in a handful of high-population
economies in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa with significant gender gaps
in smartphone ownership. Basic phone ownership, on the other hand, is more
equitable. Overall, being from a poor household has a greater impact on both
financial account ownership and mobile phone ownership than does being a woman
(refer to figure ES.3).

Executive summary xxv
Formal saving has surged globally, enabled by mobile accounts and breaking
a long-term trend of slow growth
Formal saving is on the rise, with the increase partly driven in some regions by the
convenience, accessibility, and affordability of mobile financial services, which are
allowing people to make frequent, small-value savings deposits.
As of 2024, 40 percent of adults in low- and middle-income economies saved
formally using an account, a 16 percentage point increase from 2021. Mobile
money and other digitally enabled accounts are driving this increase in formal
saving. In both Latin America and the Caribbean and Sub-Saharan Africa, the share
of adults saving using mobile money increased by more than 10 percentage points,
reaching 19 and 23 percent of adults, respectively (refer to figure ES.4). Whereas

xxvi The Global Findex Database 2025
the largest share of adults in Sub-Saharan Africa who save formally do so using
mobile money accounts, in Latin America and the Caribbean, most adults who
save formally use both mobile money accounts and accounts at banks or similar
financial institutions. The difference between the two regions possibly reflects
stronger integration and linkages between mobile platforms and the formal
banking system in the latter.
If those who save in either a mobile money account or an account at a bank or
similar financial institution are included, 35 percent of adults saved formally in
Sub-Saharan Africa in 2024, the second-highest regional rate after that in East Asia
and Pacific. Senegal exemplifies this progress, with 67 percent of adults there saving
formally in 2024, up from 46 percent in 2021.
East Asia and Pacific continues to have the highest formal saving rate and registered
the largest rise in formal saving between 2021 and 2024, at 20 percentage points,
with the change driven by an increase of 22 percentage points in China alone.
Despite this growth, women are still less likely to save than men. Although the
share of women formally saving nearly doubled between 2021 and 2024, reaching
36 percent, men are still 7 percentage points more likely to save formally.
To build and capitalize on the benefits of formal savings, more could be done to
ensure savers get the most out of their balances. For example, in 2024, just over half
of adults who saved formally earned interest on their savings balances, highlighting
a critical opportunity both to help savers earn more money and to increase capital
flows within economies.
More adults are making digital merchant payments
Across low- and middle-income economies, 61 percent of adults, or 82 percent of
account owners, made or received a digital payment in 2024, a 27 percentage point
increase from 2014. Digital payments are the most popular formal financial service,
used by twice as many adults as saved formally and by three times as many as
borrowed formally.
Use of digital merchant payments—payments made by retail customers to
businesses in stores or online—grew to 42 percent of all adults in 2024, up from
35 percent in 2021, with variations by region (refer to figure ES.5). The share of
adults making such payments more than doubled in some economies, including
Cameroon, the Kyrgyz Republic, Paraguay, and Viet Nam, and showed widespread
adoption in Kazakhstan, Kenya, and Mongolia.

This shift to digital merchant payments benefits both buyers and sellers. Digital
payments are safer than cash payments and can help small-scale merchants access
credit by giving them real-time records of cash flows they can use to support loan
applications aimed at funding working capital or job creation. Digitalizing these
payments, however, requires interoperable fast payment systems and national-scale
infrastructure for processing payments from any provider to any other.4
This is especially important because business-related financial stress is widespread,
particularly among the self-employed, 13 percent of whom cite business expenses
as their top concern. Access to credit could help, yet in low- and middle-income
economies, only about a quarter of adults used formal credit in the past year.
An additional 35 percent relied on informal sources such as family or friends.
Business borrowing is also mostly informal: Of the 15 percent of self-employed
adults who borrowed for business purposes, most of them borrowed only
informally. This highlights the need for better access to responsible, formal credit
options and the potential of cash flow–based lending models that draw on digital
payment histories to assess creditworthiness.
Government and wage payments likewise continued their trend toward
digitalization. About 75 percent of recipients of government payments in
xxviii The Global Findex Database 2025
low- and middle-income economies5 received their government wage, pension,
or social transfer payments directly in accounts. Half of private-sector wage
recipients did likewise.
Digital payments also offer opportunities for increased income generation
when combined with active internet use. For example, with digital channels
enabled by mechanisms for payment, small business owners can more easily
reach customers and get paid, thereby growing their businesses and expanding
economic opportunities. In low- and middle-income economies, 37 percent of adults
paid their bills online, a testament to how digital channels make it easier for people
to pay for goods and services. Furthermore, 36 percent of adults purchased goods
online, pointing to greater convenience and choice for consumers and increased
income-generating opportunities for sellers.
Despite advances, many remain without mobile phones or financial accounts
and require focused programs
Not everyone has benefited equally from increased access to and use of financial
accounts and digital channels. As mentioned, women are disproportionately less
likely than men to have accounts, and being poor remains the biggest barrier to
financial access, as adults living in poorer households make up a disproportionate
share of people without accounts.
When asked why they do not have accounts, the most common reason people
without accounts give is that they do not have enough money to need or use one.
But adults without accounts also report that they cannot afford to own an account.
These barriers might be addressed with more accessible and affordable accounts
that leverage networks of local agents and offer lower pricing. Mobile money and
other digitally enabled accounts are often more likely to have these characteristics.
Adults without an account who also do not own any type of mobile phone represent
a particularly challenging segment to reach, given that they do not have the means
to leverage one of the most accessibility-driving channels for financial services. That
share is 31 percent in low- and middle-income economies and about 50 percent in
South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa (refer to figure ES.6).
Adults who lack mobile phones of any kind say that the cost of the device is the
biggest barrier they face to owning one. Making digital devices less expensive,
whether through product design, innovative pricing models, or both, will be key to
equitably increasing digital, and by extension financial, access. Free devices may not
be the solution, however, according to research showing that many recipients of free
mobile phones lose access to the devices.6

Increased digitalization and mobile financial adoption come with risks, and
not everyone is adequately protected
Of the 900 million adults in low- and middle-income economies who use mobile
money accounts, only three-quarters use passwords to protect their phones.
This could pose a risk of theft when they access their accounts, even though
many accounts require additional verification such as a personal identification
number (refer to figure ES.7). In Sub-Saharan Africa, only about half of the region’s
300 million mobile money account owners protect their phones with passwords.
Around the world, women are less likely than men to have passwords.
Financial crime is also a concern. Nearly one in five phone owners in low- and middle-
income economies received a text or SMS message from someone they did not know
asking for money. Only a small percentage say they sent money in response, but
scam prevalence nonetheless poses a risk to adults with digitally enabled accounts.

Furthermore, as efforts to grow digital financial inclusion continue, governments
must set and enforce rules for telecommunications and financial industries.
A relatively large share of adults still pay fees they did not expect for receiving
wage or government payments in an account. Whether these fees reflect additional
charges by an agent or misunderstanding about the fee schedule on the part of
the recipient, they nonetheless suggest a lack of financial capability. Setting and
enforcing rules for how industry actors market and sell their products, onboard
customers, clarify costs and fee schedules, protect deposits, and communicate
about safe use and avoiding scams can help equip new users to get the most, safely,
from mobile phone and account ownership.
Opportunities remain to better equip people to leverage financial services
to reach their goals and increase resilience
Greater account ownership and usage and increased access to digital opportunities
have not yet increased overall financial health, defined as the ability to pursue
financial goals, manage financial emergencies, and feel confident about one’s
Executive summary xxxi
finances. For example, just 56 percent of adults could easily access extra money
to deal with an unexpected event such as a loss of income or an accident (refer to
figure ES.8). That percentage is unchanged since 2021. Furthermore, only about
half of adults in low- and middle-income economies could cover their expenses for
two months or longer if they lost their primary source of income, and the other half
could cover no more than a month.
Yet there are opportunities to better link existing services to people’s financial needs
and goals. An account can be a vital resource for anyone who needs to receive
government support payments or financial support from family or friends. Saving,
borrowing, and insurance products geared for a specific purpose—such as medical
costs, which about a quarter of all adults in low- and middle-income economies say
they worry about—could help people mitigate financial stress.
Better tools to enhance people’s ability to access extra money during an emergency
are particularly important in the context of natural disasters. A quarter of adults in
low- and middle-income economies experienced a natural disaster in the three years
preceding the survey, and two-thirds of them either lost income or experienced
damage to their homes, livestock, or other assets.

Financial services providers have an opportunity to strengthen household financial
health through effective product design. Innovative products could help people
pursue their financial aspirations—such as building a business, educating children,
or planning for retirement—while also strengthening their ability to manage
unexpected financial events. Insurance, affordable loans, well-designed savings
accounts, and automatic deposits, transfers, and installment payments can help
people achieve their financial goals.
Many of the world’s 1.3 billion people without financial accounts already have
the tools they would need to get financial services
Despite high mobile phone ownership and growth in account ownership,
1.3 billion people still lack financial accounts. Many of these people have the
foundations they would need to get a digitally enabled account, however: They own
mobile phones, they have personal ID,7 and they have SIM cards registered in their
names. In an environment with robust consumer protection in which they have
access to appropriately designed, affordable, and convenient financial products, this
group could be the next beneficiaries of efforts toward financial inclusion, so long as
providers take a holistic approach to helping less financially experienced owners of
new accounts build their financial skills.
In Sub-Saharan Africa, where mobile money is prevalent, a quarter of adults without
accounts, or about 80 million people, have all three digital prerequisites for account
ownership (refer to figure ES.9). These digitally connected adults may be able to
open and use accounts more easily than their unconnected peers and represent a
key opportunity for expanding financial access and use.
One group that could particularly benefit from focused efforts to increase access
to and use of formal financial services is the 90 million adults in Sub-Saharan
Africa without accounts who receive agricultural payments in cash. Farmers might
especially benefit from having a relationship with a formal financial institution,
given that such a relationship could provide them with potential access to saving,
insurance, and credit products to help them smooth irregular earnings due to
seasonal income fluctuations and invest in agricultural inputs at the beginning of
the growing season, when cash flows tend to be tight.
Payment digitalization can also help motivate account ownership. Five percent of
adults without an account also receive a government payment in cash.8 Efforts to
make these payments directly into accounts can benefit both governments and
recipients.9 An additional 16 percent of adults without accounts receive private
wage payments in cash, although digitalizing these payments might face challenges
related to firm formalization and compliance with government obligations.

Conclusion
The high levels of mobile phone ownership and internet use and the increases in
financial account ownership and use represent significant development successes.
Dedicated financial inclusion efforts are still critical, however, to address two
key challenges. The first is reaching the remaining adults without accounts,
primarily women and poor adults, through focused, context-appropriate initiatives.
The second is developing programs, policies, and products that help everyone
improve their financial health so that they can more effectively mitigate sources
of financial worry, increase their financial resilience, and more effectively pursue
their goals.
Any effort to further expand digital and financial inclusion should take into account
the broader context to ensure that the necessary infrastructure and consumer
protections are in place. Governments and providers of financial services have
a responsibility to establish strong rules ensuring consumer protection and
implement them throughout the product design, sales, onboarding, and user
experience processes. In this way, they can play a role in designing the next wave
of efforts toward financial inclusion for people who remain underserved.

Introduction
Many of today’s common financial behaviors barely existed in 2011, when the Global
Findex launched its first edition. Since then, digital connectivity, ownership of mobile
phones, and internet use, as well as the resulting availability of mobile money and
other digitally enabled financial services, have transformed financial sectors in many
economies. One of the most visible consequences of this change, as this report
shows, is rapid increases in financial account access and usage. In 2011, 51 percent
of the world’s adults had financial accounts; as of 2024, that share had risen to
79 percent, with half of those accounts being digitally enabled, meaning their owners
could use them with a phone or payment card, such as a credit or debit card.
That is a success story for development, given how essential financial services are
for equipping people to lift themselves out of poverty or preventing a slide into
it. Though there is still important work to be done to include the 1.3 billion adults
worldwide who still do not have accounts and to narrow persistent gaps in access
and use among poorer adults and women, the trend line is positive—and has been
powerfully driven by mobile technology. The impact that mobile phones and the
internet are having extends not only to account ownership, but also to potentially
productive uses, including saving formally, which 40 percent of adults in low- and
middle-income economies now do, and making or receiving digital payments, which
more than 60 percent of adults in low- and middle-income economies also do.
The foundational role that digital connectivity plays in financial inclusion and
economic opportunities is the central theme of this fifth edition of the Global Findex.
Consistent with that theme, the report begins with a section on digital connectivity
that includes data from the Global Findex 2025 Digital Connectivity Tracker, a new
module of the Global Findex focused on digital access and usage. It is followed by
sections on the state of financial access, financial use, and financial health.
About the report and the data
As did previous editions, The Global Findex 2025 describes the data and provides
a thorough overview of the survey’s coverage and its findings. The data capture
respondents’ perceptions about their financial habits and access to and use of
financial accounts. Those perceptions may differ—sometimes significantly—from
supply-side data on account ownership reported by financial institutions to central
1
banks. The latter may show higher account ownership rates because it includes
inactive accounts and double counting. The report does not, however, attempt to
explain why changes may have occurred, nor does it speculate on the conditions
that may help one economy replicate the success of another.
The report summarizes Global Findex survey data from 141 economies collected in
the second half of 2024. About 1,000 respondents responded to the survey in each
participating economy, and the results are weighted by population. As such, they
provide an accurate, nationally representative reflection of behavior across each
surveyed economy. Given the timing of the survey, all data in this edition and the
corresponding data bank are labeled 2024. In contrast to previous editions, the
report and the database—available on the Global Findex website1—are dated with
the year 2025, based on the publication date of the report rather than the date of
data collection.
Unlike what was the case in previous editions, data collection for The Global Findex
2025 gave priority to low- and middle-income economies. Data on mobile phone
ownership, internet use, and account ownership were collected in all economies,
but questions on financial use and financial health were asked only in low- and
middle-income economies. In addition, in Algeria, China, the Islamic Republic of
Iran, Libya, Mauritius, the Russian Federation, and Ukraine, an abridged form of the
questionnaire was administered by phone because of economy-specific restrictions.
For comparability across time, averages for earlier years exclude data for Russia and
may therefore differ from previously published numbers.
Most figures and text in the report provide low- and middle-income economy
averages and averages for the six World Bank regions (excluding any high-income
economies in them): East Asia and Pacific, Europe and Central Asia, Latin America
and the Caribbean, the Middle East and North Africa, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan
Africa. Chapters also may include information on specific economies or compare
data trends by economy income group classification, specifically, in low-income,
lower-middle-income, and upper-middle-income economies. Unless specifically
noted, all data are reported as shares of all adults to make economy-to-economy
comparisons possible, and all survey questions were asked about recent behavior,
usually over the 12 months preceding the survey. Growth levels and comparisons
are statistically significant at about 4 percentage points or greater; readers are
asked not to overemphasize increases, decreases, or differences of smaller
magnitude.

2 The Global Findex Database 2025
Given the long history of the Global Findex, readers may encounter occasional
inconsistencies between time series data discussed in this report and the same data
published in previous years. These inconsistencies usually come about for one of
two reasons:
• Changes in income classification: The Global Findex uses the World Bank’s
income designations from fiscal year 2024 for the Global Findex Database 2025.
When an economy grows to the point that it “graduates” to a higher income
designation or experiences setbacks that place it in a lower income designation,
the Global Findex Database reflects that change. This can result in shifts of one
or two percentage points in the calculated average for a given indicator for an
affected income group; it can also change low- and middle-income averages if
economies have graduated to high-income status.
• COVID-19 data updates: As a result of COVID-19 mobility restrictions,
22 economies could not be surveyed in time for the release of The Global Findex
2021. Those economies were subsequently surveyed in 2022, and the data
collected were added to the database. This resulted in small adjustments to the
2021 regional, low- and middle-income, and global averages for several headline
indicators.
In addition to these time series inconsistencies, the difference between two
reported data points—such as when gender or income gaps are calculated—is
occasionally 1 percentage point greater than the value of those points would
suggest. This can happen when the difference between the two, rounded to the
nearest whole percentage point (as the data in the report are), is less than the
difference between the comparable unrounded data (which is what appears in the
database). In all such cases, the discrepancies are noted and the circumstances
explained in a footnote.
The report progresses as follows:
Section 1, Digital connectivity, reports data from the Global Findex 2025 Digital
Connectivity Tracker, including detailed data from 75 low- and middle-income
economies on ownership of mobile phones, internet use, and digital safety and the
barriers people face across all three.
Section 2, Financial access, provides updated data on the share of adults who have
financial accounts and explores opportunities to expand access for those who
do not, with analysis of the relationship between financial and digital access.
Introduction 3
Section 3, Financial use, explores trends in saving, borrowing, and use of digital
payments, as well as how digitally enabled accounts, including mobile money, are
encouraging more people to save formally and use digital payments.
Section 4, Financial health, highlights the challenges that adults continue to face—
even those with accounts—when managing their financial needs and mitigating the
risks associated with unexpected expenses or loss of income, as well as navigating
the financial sector itself.
Each section opens with a visual summary of its main findings. In addition, the
report includes three spotlights, placed after sections 1, 3, and 4, respectively.
Spotlight 1.1 presents select data from the Identification for Development (ID4D)–
Global Findex Database 2025, which are collected jointly with the World Bank’s ID4D
Initiative. This spotlight summarizes ID ownership globally and explores the barriers
to digital and financial inclusion that people face when they lack ID. Spotlight 3.1
examines data on account usage frequency and account inactivity. Spotlight 4.1
presents new data on natural disasters and the financial impact they have on those
who experience them.
All data included in the report are available on the Global Findex website, on which
readers can access the report and subsequent analysis and download the full data
bank. The website also includes a tool for reproducing images in the report and
customizing them to include particular economies of interest. Finally, readers can
visit the World Bank’s “Inclusive Digital Financial Services” web page to explore
Global Findex data visualized for every world economy. An example from this
web page for low- and middle-income economies is included between sections 2
and 3 of the report.2 Readers are invited to explore and use the data to inform
efforts to measure and promote financial inclusion and for research, starting with
this report and its core findings.

1.1 Mobile phone ownership
Mobile phones and the internet have become widespread and essential to daily life
in every economy around the world. As of 2024, individual ownership of mobile
phones reached 86 percent of adults worldwide (refer to map 1.1.1). For many
people, barely an hour goes by without their using a mobile device to make a call,
text a friend, read the news, access business information, post a meme on social
media, pay for something, play a game, engage with a colleague or a customer, or
search for information. As access to and use of digitally connected technologies
increase, people, businesses, and governments place an increasingly high priority
on online interactions.
Digitally connected technologies have clear, well-documented benefits.1 Access
to mobile phones and the internet is associated with reduced poverty, increased
consumption, and more employment for individuals in low- and middle-income
economies.2 Women also experience these benefits, as internet access enables
access to flexible jobs3 and has been shown to increase female labor force
participation.4 Mobile phones also facilitate information sharing. For instance,

in agricultural contexts, farmers’ access to real-time prices and buyer demand
data can inform their decisions on where to sell, enhancing market efficiency and
reducing the distances they would otherwise travel to get the best return for their
product and time.5 Internet access also helps create jobs6 and aids individuals and
countries in exporting goods and services.7
Owning a mobile phone furthermore enables financial access through mobile
money and other mobile financial services. These financial accounts and services,
typically offered by mobile network operators or fintech firms and accessed via
networks of local agents, are associated with lower rates of poverty,8 increased
consumption9 and savings,10 and greater resilience to economic shocks.11
Given those benefits, and the relationship between mobile phone ownership and
adoption of digital financial services, Global Findex 2025 set out to conduct the first
global demand-side survey on mobile phone ownership and internet use and the
risks people face with both (refer to box 1.1.1).
Box 1.1.1 Measuring digital connectivity: The Global Findex approach
For efficiency, this report uses the term digital connectivity to refer to access to
and use of the internet or dedicated apps by means of a device—such as a network-
connected computer, tablet, or mobile phone—to interact and transact with
individuals, businesses, financial institutions, or governments. The goal of digital
connectivity is to make these devices and related applications easy, safe, and
affordable and enable users to create economic and social value.
The Global Findex survey included a new dedicated module of questions, the Global
Findex 2025 Digital Connectivity Tracker. It collected data on personal mobile
phone ownership and use, internet use related to a range of digital activities, and
responsible digital practices such as password adoption and safe navigation of online
scams and harassment.

Box 1.1.1 Measuring digital connectivity: The Global Findex approach
(continued)
The tracker employs the following criteria in recording data related to digital
connectivity:
Adults own a mobile phone if they have any kind of mobile phone for personal use
to make and receive calls.
• Adults who own mobile phones can have either basic phones or smartphones,
depending on their response to a survey question on this point. The survey
additionally asked adults who have basic phones whether they could use WhatsApp
on their phone if they wanted to; those who responded yes have feature phones.
• Internet use is calculated based on adults who said they had used the internet
in the past three months. Measuring it in this way aims to capture current and
active use, and the definition is aligned with that used by the International
Telecommunication Union to measure progress against the Sustainable
Development Goals (Indicator 17.8.1).
• Only respondents who said they used the internet or owned a smartphone
answered survey questions about digital activities such as social media use or
online learning.
The Global Findex 2025 Digital Connectivity Tracker was fielded in person in 75
economies during the second half of 2024. Respondents in all high-income economies
and in an additional seven low- and middle-income economies—specifically, Algeria,
China, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Libya, Mauritius, the Russian Federation, and
Ukraine—were surveyed by phone and therefore were asked only a limited subset of
the tracker questions. Data used in calculating regional averages and those for low-
and middle-income countries exclude results for several of these economies—China
and Russia among them. The “Methodology” tab of the Global Findex website (http://
globalfindex.worldbank.org) provides details on the information collected in each
surveyed economy.
Mobile phone ownership is widespread nearly everywhere
According to data from the Global Findex 2025 Digital Connectivity Tracker,
86 percent of adults worldwide, and 84 percent of adults in low- and
middle-income economies, own personal mobile phones (refer to figure 1.1.1).

Note: See the text for definitions of basic phones, feature phones, and smartphones. The asterisk next to
Algeria, China, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Libya, Mauritius, the Russian Federation, and Ukraine indicates
that respondents in these economies were surveyed by phone rather than in person.
Mobile phone ownership 19
These handheld devices have become so popular and ubiquitous that only nine low-
and lower-middle-income economies have average mobile phone ownership rates
below 65 percent.12 An additional share of adults do not have their own phone (and
therefore are not included among phone owners) and instead use someone else’s:
depending on the region, between 31 percent and 54 percent of adults without their
own phones use someone else’s.
Mobile phone ownership varies by type across regions and economies; the survey
differentiates between owners of smartphones and owners of basic phones.
It defines smartphones as having the ability to run applications and having full-
function web browsers. Smartphones represent most of the mobile phone stock in
all but 18 of the economies surveyed.
Basic phones let users make phone calls, send text messages, and use streamlined
services such as mobile money, with payment transactions executed via the
Unstructured Supplementary Service Data protocol. Of the 18 economies in which
basic phones dominate, 17 are in Sub-Saharan Africa (Bangladesh is the remaining
economy). India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka in South Asia also have relatively large
shares of basic phone owners.
A type of basic phone referred to here as a feature phone may include preloaded
versions of WhatsApp or other basic tools; some feature phones also let owners
view text-only HTML web pages. Feature phones represent a very small share of all
mobile phones and are more commonly found in the economies of Latin America
and the Caribbean relative to those in other regions.
Basic and feature phones’ limited functionality and lower levels of data consumption
make them more affordable than smartphones, which is particularly important
for people with low incomes. Batteries in basic phones also hold their charges
for longer, which benefits phone owners in economies in which electricity is
intermittent. Their limited functionality may affect owners’ access to a range of
digital resources, however, including the internet.
Poorer adults and women are less likely to own mobile phones,
particularly smartphones
Despite widespread mobile phone ownership, certain adults—particularly those
living in the poorest 40 percent of households and those who are out of the
12 Most of the economies with mobile phone ownership rates below 65 percent are in Sub-Saharan Africa; these include
Chad, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Niger, and Sierra Leone.
The only economy outside of Sub-Saharan Africa with a mobile phone ownership rate less than 65 percent is Pakistan.
20 The Global Findex Database 2025
workforce, as well as people living in rural environments and (in some economies)
women—are less likely than those living in higher-income households, those in the
workforce, urban dwellers, and men to own their own mobile phones. Income level
often influences mobile phone ownership among members of all these groups,
likely driving the greater equity seen in basic phone ownership and wider inequity
in smartphone ownership, since smartphones are more expensive to buy and to
own than basic phones are. The following subsections explore these differences
in more detail.
Income gaps in mobile phone ownership exist in nearly every region and
economy, though with nuances
In low- and middle-income economies, the overall gap in mobile phone ownership
between people living in households in the poorest 40 percent (by income) and
those living in the wealthiest 60 percent is 8 percentage points (refer to figure 1.1.2,
panel a). Nearly every economy in this group has an income gap in mobile phone
ownership.
There are also gaps based on education, employment, and rural residency, each of
them strongly associated with income. Specifically, among adults with a primary
education or less, 75 percent own a mobile phone, compared with 93 percent of
adults with a secondary education or more, an 18 percentage point difference. In
addition to often earning less than more-educated peers, people with a primary
education or less generally have lower literacy rates and are more likely to live
in rural areas. These dynamics are particularly evident in Sub-Saharan Africa.
Approaches to digital inclusion for adults with low levels of education must
therefore take education into account, because it may affect how people use digital
platforms and may make them more vulnerable to digital exploitation.
In regard to employment, 86 percent of wage-employed adults in low- and
middle-income economies have a mobile phone compared with 81 percent of
self-employed adults and just 68 percent of those who are out of the workforce
(refer to figure 1.1.2, panel c).
Making digital connectivity for wage-employed adults a priority can help them
leverage financial apps to manage their incomes. The self-employed also have
high potential for gaining economic benefit from connectivity, because owning a
personal mobile phone can help them communicate with customers and buyers
more effectively and make it easier for them to get paid directly in a mobile money
account, a topic explored in more detail in chapter 3.3.

Note: The data used for regional averages exclude data for several large economies in which respondents were
surveyed by phone rather than in person, including China and the Russian Federation. The “Methodology” tab
of the Global Findex website (http://globalfindex.worldbank.org) provides details on the information collected
in each surveyed economy.
Rural residency is also associated with lower rates of mobile phone ownership:
77 percent of rural residents own a phone compared with 90 percent of urban
dwellers, a 12 percentage point difference (refer to figure 1.1.2, panel d).13 Though
there are income and cost factors involved—discussed later in the context of
barriers to phone ownership—the connectivity gap between rural and urban
residents is also driven by supply-side factors related to limited coverage of cell
towers and broadband infrastructure. These barriers will be important to overcome
as part of holistic strategies to increase connectivity rates.
13 The Global Findex reports data as whole percentage points, although it calculates that whole based on rounding
up or down from the tenths place. As such, any discrepancies between the reported size of a gap and the
difference between its end points is due to rounding.
24 The Global Findex Database 2025
Not all groups with low incomes are less likely to own a mobile phone, however.
For example, there are generally no statistically significant differences in mobile
phone ownership related to age: young adults ages 15 to 24 are as likely to own a
mobile phone as adults older than 25 everywhere except Sub-Saharan Africa (refer
to figure 1.1.2, panel e).
Though women on average are less likely than men to own mobile phones,
the differences are small to nonexistent in most economies
On average, women around the globe are 8 percentage points less likely than
men to own a mobile phone. In low- and middle-income economies, women are
9 percentage points less likely (refer to figure 1.1.2, panel b).
Yet unlike differences in mobile phone ownership based on income, which are
present at some level in most economies, the gender differences in low- and middle-
income economies are driven by larger-than-average differences (between 14 and
25 percentage points) in a small number of high-population economies, specifically,
Bangladesh, the Arab Republic of Egypt, Ethiopia, and India. A fifth economy,
Pakistan, has an ownership difference of 65 percentage points between women
and men. In total, more than 300 million women without phones live in these five
economies. On the other hand, 96 economies, including 55 low- and middle-income
economies, do not have statistically significant gender gaps in mobile phone
ownership.
In every demographic group, the differences by gender in mobile phone ownership
are larger when smartphones as opposed to basic phones are considered. Gender
differences in basic phone ownership specifically are statistically nonsignificant in
every region except for South Asia, where the data for Pakistan drive a larger gap.
In contrast, smartphone ownership is equitable only in East Asia and Pacific. Certain
economies, including Chad, Ethiopia, and Pakistan, counter that trend, with gender
disparities in both basic phone ownership and smartphone ownership; they are the
exception, however.
Income and gender also interact to affect how likely women are to own mobile
phones, particularly smartphones, with the influence of these two factors varying
by region. In the Middle East and North Africa, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa,
both poorer women and higher-income women are less likely to own a smartphone
than are men in the same income brackets. Smaller differences exist between
women and men with similar incomes in Latin America and the Caribbean. In East
Asia and Pacific and Europe and Central Asia, women own smartphones as often as
men in the same income groups.
Mobile phone ownership 25
SIM card ownership adds another layer of complexity to the income and
gender gaps
A SIM card is necessary for using a mobile phone to do almost anything. SIM cards
identify a mobile phone to a mobile network and often store information about the
phone’s owner. In many economies, purchasers need some form of identification to
buy a SIM card from a mobile network operator, and certain digital services typically
require that the SIM card in the phone of the person using the service be registered
in that user’s name. In the case of financial services such as mobile money, this is
because many of these services use SIMs in the onboarding process for mobile
banking or mobile money or to register customers to use a payment platform.
They may use customers’ SIM card numbers as network IDs to verify the identity of
account owners when they make instant payments or apply for credit.
Across low- and middle-income economies, 23 percent of mobile phone owners have
SIM cards in their phones that are registered in someone else’s name, not their own. In
African economies such as the Comoros, the Republic of Congo, Morocco, and Tanzania,
as well as in Jordan and Nepal, the share of mobile phone owners whose phones do not
have a SIM card registered in their own name exceeds 40 percent (refer to figure 1.1.3).
Women who own mobile phones are as likely as men who own mobile phones to
have SIM cards in their own names in East Asia and Pacific and Latin America and the
Caribbean. All other regions show fewer women than men owning mobile phones
with SIM cards in their own names. The difference is smallest in Sub-Saharan Africa,
at 5 percentage points. In Europe and Central Asia, the Middle East and North Africa,
and South Asia, the difference is at least 20 percentage points (refer to figure 1.1.4).
There are probably several reasons why people’s mobile phones have SIM cards registered
to someone else. In some cases, people may use phones they purchased secondhand
or phones handed down to them from family members or friends whose SIM cards
they never replaced with one of their own. In other cases, one family or community
member may travel to a nearby city to buy multiple SIM cards on behalf of others and
then distribute them. Finally, in some economies in Sub-Saharan Africa, adults report a
lack of identification as a barrier to purchasing a SIM card of a mobile phone (refer to
spotlight 1.1). These issues point to secondary disparities in income and by gender.
A small share of adults around the world experience the opposite dynamic: they
have SIM cards in their names but do not own a mobile phone. This lets them use a
household mobile phone or borrow another person’s mobile phone and swap in their
own SIM card. This is not a widespread practice, however. In South Asia and Sub-
Saharan Africa, the regions where this is most common, only 2 percent of adults have
SIM cards in their names but no phone of their own.

Everyone who owns a mobile phone uses it, often for a
variety of purposes
People who own mobile phones use them. Across low- and middle-income
economies, 91 percent of mobile phone owners—nearly 70 percent of adults in
those places—use their phones daily, and an additional 6 percent use them at least
weekly. Even in Sub-Saharan Africa, where data rates are among the most expensive
in the world, a large majority of mobile phone owners use their phones daily (refer
to figure 1.1.5). Daily use rates among mobile phone owners dip below 80 percent
in just seven economies, five of them in Sub-Saharan Africa: Chad, the Comoros,
Guatemala, Lesotho, Mali, Morocco, and Togo.

The primary barrier to mobile phone ownership is the cost of the device
Any discussion of digital connectivity would be incomplete if it did not take a close
look at adults who do not have their own mobile phones, to understand the barriers
to ownership they face.
As mentioned, these adults tend to have low incomes and are more likely to be
women than men. Though there are some people without mobile phones in every
economy in the world, a disproportionate share live in South Asia and Sub-Saharan
Africa (the only regions with mobile phone account ownership rates less than
85 percent), and particularly in large-population economies with lower-than-average
connectivity rates, such as Bangladesh, Egypt, Ethiopia, India, and Pakistan.
The Global Findex survey asked respondents without phones to identify all the
barriers they faced to owning a mobile phone, then asked them to choose the main
barrier.14 In South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, the barrier people overwhelmingly
cited most often as among those preventing them from having a mobile phone is
that they cannot afford to buy the device: 69 percent and 77 percent, respectively,
of adults without a mobile phone in these two regions said this (refer to figure 1.1.6,
panels a and b). When they name the main barrier precluding mobile phone
ownership, money remains primary. Across both regions, among all adults as well as
among women, people in lower-income households, and both people living in rural
environments and those living in urban ones, not having enough money for a device
is cited as the main barrier to mobile phone ownership.
14 Questions regarding barriers to phone ownership are adapted from the questionnaire used in the GSMA Mobile
Money Tracker (GSMA 2025).

Note: Respondents could choose more than one reason. Percentages in parentheses represent the share of adults in each group who do not own a mobile phone.
Among those naming any barrier to phone ownership, data costs also come up
as a barrier in these two regions, especially South Asia. Low levels of literacy and
high rates of illiteracy similarly discourage mobile phone ownership, with difficulty
reading or typing cited as a common barrier in both regions.
Costs come up again as a barrier in the context that many people use someone else’s
phone rather than owning their own. In South Asia, 49 percent of adults who do not
own a mobile phone use someone else’s, and in Sub-Saharan Africa 31 percent do.
Non-owning phone users present an opportunity to increase connectivity, since this
group already shows demand for and some skill with digital devices.
Family or community disapproval is a less common, though still statistically
significant, barrier to phone ownership. It is the second- or third-most-common
reason for people not having phones in the Republic of Congo and Uganda, where
it is also cited more commonly by women than by men. Also in Pakistan, 40 percent
of women without a phone name family disapproval as a reason for not having
one, whereas no men say the same.15 It is important to note as well that counter
to expectations about gender norms, family or community disapproval is among
the least commonly cited barriers, and naming it as a barrier is not generally more
prevalent among women than among men.
A lack of reliable mobile network coverage also affects mobile phone ownership in
some economies. In Chad, for instance, 54 percent of adults who do not own mobile
phones name lack of coverage as prohibitive; in India, 29 percent do. One caveat to
this observation, however, is that people without mobile phones may not have an
accurate sense of mobile network coverage.
Finally, some people say they do not own a mobile phone for reasons of personal
safety. This might include fear of phone theft, as well as worries about receiving
unwanted, threatening, or harassing calls and messages. South Asia has the highest
share of adults without a phone giving this reason, at 37 percent, including about
40 percent of women and men without phones in India.
Expanding mobile phone ownership to those who do not yet own a phone of any
kind means overcoming these barriers, with cost being the most salient. However,
providing free phones may not be the solution, as the evidence suggests that doing
so may lead to limited long-run and often gender-inequitable outcomes.16
15 Only 5 percent of men in Pakistan do not have a phone.

32 The Global Findex Database 2025
For example, a study in rural Tanzania for which women were given free smartphones
found that the households in which they lived increased their annual consumption of
food and basic needs per capita by 20 percent relative to households that received a
basic phone or cash. By the end of the intervention, however, only a third of women
given smartphones still had them.17 Another study in rural Malawi similarly assigned
smartphones to some women participants, but in this case invited the husbands of
half of the women to take part in a training program designed to increase acceptance
of women’s smartphone use. There were no differences in mobile phone retention
and use between those who participated in the couples-based training and those who
did not.18 Finally, in a government program in India to distribute phones and roll out
mobile towers in rural communities, nearly 40 percent of women had lost control
over their devices within a month after distribution (98 percent of women said they
had received the phones). Five years later, researchers found no persistent effects in
ownership, gender norms, and economic outcomes in areas eligible to receive free
phones compared with other areas.19 This research suggests that any interventions
to overcome barriers to mobile phone ownership must account for intrahousehold
dynamics and entrenched gender norms.
In contrast to distribution of free smartphones, pay-as-you-go (PAYGo) financing,
which enables users to pay for smartphone purchases in installments over time,
attempts to make smartphones more affordable while keeping cost salient. Such
an approach in theory could attract people who want a smartphone and will use
it (because they have to pay for it) while filtering out, for example, those who
view the phone itself as an asset they can sell. PAYGo financing programs include
lockout technology, so that lenders can remotely disable phones if borrowers miss
a payment. PAYGo-financed smartphones are prevalent in some low- and middle-
income economies as part of bundled offerings with solar home systems. Research
suggests that PAYGo programs can generate significant welfare gains for users,
equivalent to an increase of more than 3 percent in income over a two-year period
and as much as 5 percent for lower-risk consumers.20 Providing incentives to offer
these schemes to women—who may otherwise struggle to afford a phone—may
hold promise for policies targeting device affordability.
Expanding equity in mobile phone ownership will require solutions that make
devices more affordable for everyone. Doing so will be essential for enabling not
just phone ownership but the use of the internet and online apps for a range of
purposes discussed in the next chapter.

1.2 Internet use
In addition to asking about mobile phone ownership, the Global Findex 2025 Digital
Connectivity Tracker asked respondents about their use of the internet and whether
they use a mobile phone to get online. To understand the nature of respondents’
current and active internet use, the survey asked respondents whether they had
engaged in any of a variety of digital activities in the past three months. The survey
questions distinguish between activities that require only a basic phone and those
that depend on the internet and therefore require a smartphone or other internet-
enabled device.
The digital activities discussed in this chapter fall into three categories:
communication-focused activities, such as texting, posting on social media, and
sending voice messages or photos; information-focused activities, such as keeping
up with current events, learning, and accessing government information or services;
and income-generating activities, such as looking for jobs and using websites
to earn money. The chapter begins with an overview of internet use and then
examines each of these types of activity individually.
Most internet users get online with a smartphone
Many people who own mobile phones use them to access the internet, and
internet-based uses are often key to the economic and social benefits people derive
from these devices. Global Findex 2025 Digital Connectivity Tracker data show
that 71 percent of adults worldwide and 67 percent of adults in low- and middle-
income economies used the internet in the three months before taking the survey.1
Most of them used the internet at least weekly.
Internet use differed by region (refer to figure 1.2.1). Whereas 80 percent or more
of adults in East Asia and Pacific, Europe and Central Asia, and Latin America
and the Caribbean used the internet in the three months preceding the survey,
only 45 percent or less of adults in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa did so.
Trends in internet use in Middle Eastern economies resemble those in Europe
and Central Asia, whereas trends in North African economies resemble those in
Sub-Saharan Africa.
1 The Global Findex 2025 asked adults whether they used the internet in the week preceding the survey interview.
If the answer was no, respondents were asked a follow-up question about whether they used the internet in the
past three months. Adults who answered yes to either of these questions were coded as having used the internet
in the past three months.

Note: The data used for regional averages and for the average for low- and middle-income economies
exclude data for several large economies in which respondents were surveyed by phone rather than in
person, including China and the Russian Federation. The “Methodology” tab of the Global Findex website
(http://globalfindex.worldbank.org) provides details on the information collected in each surveyed economy.
Adults in the poorest 40 percent of households by income and women are less
likely than wealthier adults and men to use the internet. In low- and middle-income
economies, the internet use gap by income is 20 percentage points: more than twice
the size of the overall mobile phone gap by income. It is analogous to the income
gap among smartphone users of 18 percentage points. A detailed look at individual
economies shows that almost every economy has an income gap in internet use.
The gender gap in internet use is considerably narrower than the income gap and
less consistent across different regions. In low- and middle-income economies,
women are 6 percentage points less likely than men to use the internet (a difference
that is not exclusively a function of access, as it holds as well among people
who own smartphones). Only the Middle East and North Africa, South Asia, and
Sub-Saharan Africa have statistically significant gender gaps in internet use, at
9 percentage points, 21 percentage points, and 12 percentage points, respectively
(refer to figure 1.2.2). Only one in three individual economies shows a gender gap in
internet use.

Smartphones are the primary channel for internet access. In low- and middle-
income economies, 92 percent of smartphone owners used the internet in the
three months preceding the 2024 survey (refer to figure 1.2.3). The inverse is also
true: 89 percent of internet users in low- and middle-income economies own a
smartphone. This finding corroborates earlier data on the relationship between
smartphone ownership and internet access.2 In contrast, just 20 percent of
adults with a basic phone use the internet. The correlation between smartphone
ownership and internet use is so strong that the income and gender gaps in
smartphone ownership are both within 4 percentage points of the income and
gender gaps in internet usage.

Note: The data used for regional averages exclude data for several large economies in which
respondents were surveyed by phone rather than in person, including China and the Russian Federation.
The “Methodology” tab of the Global Findex website (http://globalfindex.worldbank.org) provides details on
the information collected in each surveyed economy.
Latin America and the Caribbean—in part because feature phones are prevalent
there—has the largest share of adults using the internet without owning a
smartphone. People who use someone else’s device account for a small part of that
share.
Another 11 percent of adults in the region use free wifi or internet connections
available in cafes, libraries, schools, or other public spaces, the largest share
anywhere in the world. Overall, just 5 percent of adults in all low- and middle-income
economies access the internet exclusively using free resources.
This tight association between smartphone ownership and internet use also means
that specific digital activities are largely contingent on owning a smartphone,
regardless of income status or gender.
With this perspective on use of the internet and how people are accessing it, the
next subsection considers how connected adults use their mobile phones and
40 The Global Findex Database 2025
the internet across the three categories of digital activities mentioned earlier:
communication-focused, information-focused, and income-generating activities.
Internet users engage in a wide variety of digital activities
Internet usage patterns vary greatly in regard to how people engage in different
digital activities over time. To provide a better understanding of patterns of use,
Global Findex 2025 examines the data to identify clusters of people using the
internet in similar ways. The largest cluster of adults, representing about 9 percent
of internet users, use their mobile phones exclusively for four digital activities:
texting, using social media, sending voice messages, and sending photos. These
happen to be the four most popular digital activities, in order of popularity. Another
9 percent of internet users learn online using their phones, as well as engaging in
the preceding four activities.
The next-largest cluster of internet users, about 7 percent, do not use the internet
for any of the specific digital activities asked about in the survey. This group also
uses the internet less frequently than the average, suggesting potential pressure
resulting from data costs. Frequency of use is discussed later in this subsection.
Such wide variation in usage patterns points to significant diversity of digital
experiences, as well as widespread opportunities to increase internet use for a
range of activities.
Most mobile phone owners embrace the ability to communicate
The Global Findex asked adults whether in the previous three months they had
engaged in four distinct, communication-based activities that require either
a basic phone or a smartphone: texting, reading or posting on social media,
sending recorded audio messages, and sending photos. The survey asked all
respondents about texting, and only those who either said they used the internet
or that they had a smartphone about the other three and all subsequent digital
activities.
Texting is broadly popular in almost every economy and does not require a
smartphone; any type of mobile phone provides a user with the ability to text.
Among adults in low- and middle-income economies, 47 percent both receive
and send texts, and 56 percent of mobile phone owners do so. Only in a few Sub-
Saharan African (refer to figure 1.2.4) and South Asian economies do 50 percent
or less of mobile phone owners send and receive texts, potentially because of low
degrees of literacy skills.

Literacy in this context is more nuanced than whether someone can read and
write. In some economies, people who can read their native alphabet or script
but cannot read Latin characters may experience literacy barriers to sending
and receiving text messages. This is especially true in places where basic phones
are common, as these phones’ touchpads may offer only Latin characters. For
example, women in South Asia are less likely than men to be able to read Latin
characters. They may therefore be unable to read and respond to a text message
written using the Latin alphabet, even if the message is in phonetic Hindi or Urdu
(refer to figure 1.2.5).
Expanding access to smartphones can help in this regard, as they enable users
to employ a range of character-based keyboards, which allow them to type in
the script they prefer. For basic phone users, particularly those with low levels of
literacy, interactive voice response technologies can also provide an accessible
solution. These audio-based technologies allow users to navigate menu options
verbally or via keypad inputs, helping them access critical services without
requiring text literacy. Governments in low- and middle-income economies often
use such technologies for service delivery, with evidence suggesting that doing so
can help improve health care and agricultural outcomes and enhance consumer
protection.3

Social media is the next-most-popular digital activity after texting.4 Across low- and
middle-income economies, 45 percent of adults and 80 percent of internet users
were active on social media in the three months before taking the survey. East
Asia and Pacific had the highest average share of adults who were active on social
media. A slightly smaller share of all adults used social media than the share who
sent text messages (refer to figure 1.2.6).
Though most people think of social media as a way to keep up with friends and family
(hence its position among the communication activities) and sometimes to gather
information or simply pass the time, it can also help small and medium enterprises
communicate with new customers, which can increase sales. In fact, studies have
shown that social media use is positively associated with improved firm performance
in Pakistan5 and Oman.6 Another study measured the welfare effects of 10 digital
services (like Google Search, YouTube, and Facebook) across 13 countries. It estimates
that these platforms generate more than US$2.5 trillion in consumer benefits, with a
larger share of the gains going to lower-income individuals.7
4 Respondents were asked whether they “used social media, like Facebook or TikTok, on a mobile phone.”

44 The Global Findex Database 2025
Those who use social media to generate income typically must be able to upload
product photos and record and post audio messages. In low- and middle-income
economies, 41 percent of adults and 74 percent of smartphone owners uploaded
or sent a photo in the three months preceding the survey, and 38 percent of adults
and 68 percent of smartphone owners sent a recorded audio message. These
activities also have value for people who leverage online channels to earn money
independent of their personal social media use.
Informational activities such as consuming news and learning
are also popular
The Global Findex 2025 Digital Connectivity Tracker includes answers to questions
about three common information-focused activities: reading about news; accessing
online learning, training, or educational information; and accessing government
services or information.
In low- and middle-income economies, 39 percent of adults and 71 percent of
internet users read or watch the news online. The benefits of doing this include
knowledge of current events locally and across their economies, including political
happenings. A study on political knowledge in the United States found that after
news outlets introduced paywalls there in the early 2010s, survey respondents
were between 2 and 3 percentage points less likely to answer questions about
political subjects correctly.8 This positive relationship between news access and
civic knowledge can affect how citizens interact with their governments and even
how those governments allocate and disburse public funds. For example, mobile
applications have been shown to be useful for holding middle management
accountable in health care and agricultural settings, enhancing bureaucratic
accountability.9 Better-informed populations have in some instances received more
and larger relief payments in times of crisis,10 and they demand greater political
accountability.11
Accessing learning, training, or educational materials is the next-most-popular
information activity. An average of 26 percent of adults in low- and middle-income
economies and 46 percent of internet users used the web for this purpose. The
popularity of online learning is much higher in some economies, some of which had
mobility restrictions in 2024 due to extreme weather events or conflict.12

Widespread access to online learning could reduce educational inequality, in theory,
by enabling learners to access high-quality instruction previously available only
to students of elite institutions.13 Simultaneously, online resources could enhance
the effectiveness and skills of local teachers who provide services complementary
to the online experience, like personalized guidance, application support, and
responsive feedback.14 Evidence also shows some benefit for teachers in the
form of resource and information access from leveraging internet and artificial
intelligence search tools.15 Empirical research testing this theory shows limited
effects on labor market outcomes, however, in part because of low retention rates
in most online-learning settings.16 Nonetheless, the internet can be a lifeline during
interruptions to schooling. During the COVID-19 pandemic, combined phone and
SMS-based educational interventions in Botswana increased learning by 0.121
standard deviation and reduced absolute innumeracy by 31 percent.17 Researchers
are continuing to investigate where and in what circumstances technology-enabled
learning can bring the most benefit.18
The final category of informational activity included in the Global Findex 2025
Digital Connectivity Tracker is accessing government resources or searching for
government information online. In low- and middle-income economies, 18 percent
of adults did this, and 33 percent of internet users. These rates depend on whether
a government offers online services and information, however, and rates reflect that
availability (or lack thereof) as much as they do end-user demand.
Both citizens and governments can benefit when people access government
services and information online. When this information is digitally available, citizens
with internet access can retrieve any information they need at any time of day. In
an extreme example, Estonia provides online access to all its government services.
Residents can file taxes in just three minutes, and entrepreneurs can fill out the
forms they need to start a business and have them approved in just three hours.
Providing online access to government services saves the economy an estimated
2 percent of GDP annually.19
Digitalization of government services also has the potential to increase transparency
and enable real-time data sharing between agencies, addressing fragmentation

in business-government interactions. In Croatia, for example, using digital tools
such as an integrated case management system to record and track the progress
of all court cases directly improved judicial efficiency.20 Evaluations of the system
also showed a reduction in firm costs, since tying up resources in prolonged court
proceedings can impede firm operations. Other examples show that e-procurement
in India and Indonesia substantially improved the quality of goods and services
procured by facilitating the engagement of high-quality contractors.21
A relatively small share of adults use online channels to earn money or
search for a job
Development advocates herald the internet as a potential place for people to earn
money. Some research even shows digital work opportunities can boost income
for women.22 Yet only 6 percent of adults in low- and middle-income economies
and 11 percent of internet users use apps or websites to earn money. Outside East
Asia and Pacific, where 12 percent of all adults earn money on the internet—more
than 10 percent of adults in every economy in the region—only a small number
of economies breach the 10 percent threshold: Argentina, Eswatini, and Iraq, with
11 percent; Brazil, Mauritania, and South Africa, with 12 percent; Lesotho, with
13 percent; Senegal, with 15 percent; Belize, with 16 percent; and Namibia, with
17 percent. All have mobile phone ownership rates near or above 80 percent.
Notwithstanding those low participation rates, research shows that online selling
platforms can help sellers connect with potential buyers more efficiently. A survey
of small firms in South Asia without formal registration (that is, informal firms) finds
that sellers that joined e-commerce platforms saw their businesses expand.23
Searching for or applying for jobs online is more common than earning money
online. In low- and middle-income economies, 11 percent of adults and 20 percent
of internet users look for or apply for work online. In the Middle East and North
Africa, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa, the share totals 10 percent or less,
whereas it is between 10 and 16 percent in East Asia and Pacific, Europe and Central
Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean. In a handful of economies across the
world, more than 20 percent of adults look for jobs online.
Many people in low- and middle-income economies seek government jobs because
they are among the most consistent salaried jobs available to people with lower

incomes.24 Furthermore, efforts to train workers to use online job platforms have
increased employment opportunities.25 Job postings give people a big motivator
to stay connected in economies in which federal and local governments post open
positions on the web. Online job postings are not associated with shorter periods
of unemployment26 but do enable individuals who are already employed to find
new job opportunities more easily than through word of mouth or printed job
advertisements.27
In general, those who use the web to earn money are not the same people who
use it to look for jobs. A small share of adults in low- and middle-income economies
do both.
Barriers to internet use start with smartphone device costs
Given the important role smartphones play as an internet access channel, the most
significant barrier for people who do not use the internet is that they do not own a
smartphone. Given that, the Global Findex asked adults with only a basic phone why
they did not own a smartphone.
As they were regarding ownership of any kind of mobile phone, survey respondents
were asked first about any of the barriers they faced to smartphone ownership
and then were asked to choose the main barrier. The discussion here focuses on
the regions in which about 20 percent or more of adults do not have smartphones:
Latin America and the Caribbean, the Middle East and North Africa, South Asia, and
Sub-Saharan Africa.
As is the case in regard to owning any phone, among survey respondents who
specified any barriers, the main barrier to owning a smartphone is device cost
(refer to figure 1.2.7, panels a–d). As a point of reference, across low- and middle-
income economies, an entry-level internet-enabled handset costs 18 percent of the
average adult’s monthly income, according to a GSMA cost analysis using supply-
side data.28 It is 24 percent of women’s average monthly income, compared with
12 percent of men’s. In Sub-Saharan Africa specifically, an entry-level device costs
73 percent of the average monthly income for adults in the poorest 40 percent of
households.

Note: Respondents could choose more than one reason. Percentages in parentheses represent the share of adults who do not own a smartphone.
The expense of mobile minutes is the next-most-common barrier mentioned among
those naming any reason. It registers as particularly important for people in Latin
America and the Caribbean, where more women than men and more poor than
wealthier adults cite it as a barrier.
Difficulty reading or typing is also a major hurdle cited in each region. Overcoming
this barrier is challenging, given its likely connection to low levels of literacy or
illiteracy, but technology advances now becoming more available on smartphones
could help. Current generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools increasingly
embedded in smartphone-based applications can help convert speech to text easily
and vice versa, making digital services potentially accessible to those with limited
literacy or with physical disabilities. Nonetheless, there are real challenges regarding
“low-resource languages,” as there is a limited body of digital texts available to train
the large language models on which GenAI runs. With time, targeted investments in
linguistic data sets for underrepresented languages, coupled with development of
specialized AI, may serve users with low levels of literacy much better.29
The remaining barriers—unreliable coverage, personal safety concerns, no
need for a phone, and disapproval from family or community—all play a role in
nonownership of smartphones, but at different levels of relevance depending on
the region. Safety concerns are particularly salient for nonowners of smartphones in
Latin America and the Caribbean, for example, and are the second-most-prevalent
reason people there give.
Data costs are a barrier to more, and more frequent, internet use in low- and
middle-income economies
For people with smartphones, additional barriers to internet use potentially arise
in the cost of mobile data. As discussed in chapter 1.1, data costs are not a primary
barrier to ownership among those without any kind of phone. They do come up
as a reason for not owning a smartphone, however, and they influence behavioral
patterns among those who use the internet.
Monthly unlimited data plans for mobile phone owners are uncommon outside
high-income economies. Instead, people buy a certain amount of data (1 gigabyte,
for example), and then top up their data when they run low. This can be prohibitively
expensive, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, which has the highest mobile data costs
in the world as a percentage of household income and 6 of the world’s 10 most
expensive economies for mobile data.30 According to analysis by GSMA, 1 gigabyte
29 Pava et al. (2025).
30 Broadband Genie (n.d.); ITU (2023b).
Internet use 51
of data in the region costs an average 2.4 percent of monthly income and 5 percent
of the average income of people in the poorest 40 percent.31
Data costs track with internet use when how frequently phone owners purchase
data is compared with how often they use the internet. In every region but Sub-
Saharan Africa, the largest share of adults use the internet daily and buy data
monthly. In India, for example, almost three-quarters of internet users purchase
data monthly. In Sub-Saharan Africa, however, it is more common to see internet
use tightly aligned with data purchases. Daily is still the most common frequency
at which internet use occurs, but Sub-Saharan Africa has a much smaller share of
daily internet users than any other region. Yet nearly three times as many users
make weekly or daily data purchases as make monthly ones (refer to figure 1.2.8).
This may suggest that high costs and limited liquidity prevent many adults in Sub-
Saharan Africa from affording larger data bundles, even if these bundles offer lower
costs per minute and align with their expected usage.
Expanding access to high-quality broadband internet in low- and middle-income
economies by, among other things, increasing competition and pursuing policies
that support equitable access may help lower data costs in these economies and
generally help expand digital connectivity. Failure to do so risks exacerbating
the existing digital divide between high-income and low- and middle-income
economies.32 Broadband internet also will become more essential for increasing
access to data-heavy applications, such as those that enable digital learning, much
of whose content is in video formats.
Other opportunities to expand internet use will depend on the individual and the
hoped-for benefit. Since there is no universal definition of “low” internet use, it is
hard to know what specific incentives could motivate expanded internet use or
whether they are even necessary or helpful.

in each surveyed economy.
There are, however, several design characteristics that digitally enabled products,
platforms, devices, and inclusion initiatives can adopt to help people maximize the
benefits of connectivity while minimizing its risks. Those characteristics include
safety, ease of use, and features that protect people’s personal information.
The next chapter explores those topics, collectively referred to as responsible
digital use.

1.3 Digital safety and responsible use
Having a mobile phone and using the internet potentially gives connected people
worldwide the ability to access information and resources more readily. It also
exposes users to certain risks and requires them to develop the digital skills they
need to get the most out of digital channels.
To understand more about the digital risks people face and how vulnerable they
may be to them, the Global Findex asked respondents about their use of passwords,
their exposure to scams or extortion, and whether they had experienced online
harassment. It also asked whether others imposed rules on how and when they
used their phones. The results show that there are opportunities to encourage
people to take steps to protect themselves, even though only a small share of adults
currently experience scams and harassment. Awareness could help keep those
rates low.
Passwords are not universal
Not all mobile phone owners take advantage of the most basic digital security
measure: setting up and using passwords on their personal devices. Only 60 percent
of mobile phone owners use this essential first-line defense against exploitation and
digital theft in low- and middle-income economies (refer to figure 1.3.1).
Rates of password adoption show some regional patterns. Seventeen of the
twenty economies with the lowest rates of password adoption are in Sub-Saharan
Africa.1 In contrast, password adoption reaches two-thirds to three-quarters
of mobile phone owners in the economies of East Asia and Pacific, Europe and
Central Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean, consistent with their high phone
penetration rates.
Women mobile phone owners in Europe and Central Asia and the Middle East and
North Africa, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa are about 10 percentage points
less likely than their male counterparts to protect their phones with passwords.
In East Asia and Pacific and Latin America and the Caribbean, however, women
phone owners are just as likely as men to use passwords with phones.
1 The exceptions to the low rate of password adoption in Africa are Botswana, Kenya, Namibia, Senegal, and South
Africa, where about two-thirds or more of mobile phone owners use passwords. These economies also show high
engagement with the digital activities discussed in the previous chapter.

were surveyed by phone rather than in person, including China and the Russian Federation. The
“Methodology” tab of the Global Findex website (http://globalfindex.worldbank.org) provides details on the
information collected in each surveyed economy. PIN = personal identification number.
The Global Findex also asked people who had password-protected mobile phones
whether they could change that password themselves. The responses show that
in most economies, between 15 percent and 30 percent of phone owners with
passwords cannot change them. This could be for benign reasons. For example,
a shopkeeper or a more digitally skilled family member may have helped set up a
user’s phone and its password at purchase, after which the owner forgot the steps
for changing it. Phones passed down after a family member upgrades to a more
recent model may also have the original owner’s password. In other instances,
however, someone other than the owner may control a password, creating the
potential for exploitation.
The danger of going without a password is greater in the context of digital financial
services, particularly mobile money. Across the economies of Sub-Saharan Africa,
58 The Global Findex Database 2025
about half of adults with mobile money accounts do not have passwords on
their mobile phones. Thus anyone who has the person’s phone—whether it is
a family member or a phone thief—could potentially access any balance in the
associated mobile account (with the caveat that most mobile money providers
require users to input a personal identification number, or PIN, when signing in
or transacting, thus mitigating the danger). Given that a lack of trust is often a
barrier to mobile money adoption, ensuring that people know about the benefits
of passwords and PIN use, and know how to use passwords and PINs, is important.
Women mobile money account owners are not more likely to lack a phone password
than men with mobile money are in any region.
Almost one in five mobile phone owners has rules set for them
About 15 percent of all adults in low- and middle-income economies, and 19 percent
of mobile phone owners, say that someone else sets rules about when and how
they use their devices. That share is about 5 percentage points higher in East Asia
and Pacific and Latin America and the Caribbean. In the Middle East and North
Africa, women phone owners are twice as likely as men with phones to be subject to
someone else’s rules about their phone use (refer to figure 1.3.2).
Young adults between the ages of 15 and 25 are generally more likely than those
in other age groups to say that rules for mobile phone use are imposed on them.
In Europe and Central Asia, younger adults with phones are 18 percentage points
more likely than older adults to have rules imposed on them regarding phone
use. In Latin America and the Caribbean, in contrast, younger and older adults are
equally likely to have rules imposed on them.
As with password controls, imposed rules for phone use can be relatively benign,
or they can indicate a lack of autonomy. A concerned family member, for example,
might worry about a less digitally savvy person’s exposure to inappropriate content
or to online harassment or about “excessive” digital use, and thus may set rules
to protect that person. Alternatively, those rules may be a form of control by an
authoritarian relative or intimate partner.
Exposure to digital harassment in the form of offensive messages, photos, or videos
is less common than having rules set for phone use: 7 percent of adults (9 percent
of mobile phone owners) have experienced this form of harassment in low- and
middle-income economies. Women are in general as likely as or less likely than men
to experience online harassment (refer to figure 1.3.2). It is worth noting, however,
that the question is subjective, and women may perceive harassment differently
from men. Only in a handful of economies in Sub-Saharan Africa do digital
harassment rates exceed 20 percent of adults with mobile phones, among them
Ghana, Kenya, Mauritania, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Uganda, and Zambia.

Exposure to scams or extortion attempts is high among online
users, though few lose money to them
Exposure to digital exploitation is more common than online harassment. In low-
and middle-income economies, 14 percent of adults, or 19 percent of phone owners,
report having received a text or SMS message from someone they don’t know
asking for money in the context of a scam or online extortion. Latin America and the
Caribbean and Sub-Saharan Africa both have regional averages of about 30 percent.
In about a dozen different economies worldwide, about a third or more of adults
have received messages asking for money.

Adults who are exposed to a digital scam are asked if they sent money to their
scammers; only a small share say they did. In a few economies, however, mobile
phone owners have both high levels of exposure to scams or extortion and a high
tendency to send funds, including Gabon, Ghana, and Senegal (refer to figure 1.3.3).
Women are not overall more likely than men to receive scams or extortion attempts
or to send money in response.
Opportunities exist to increase responsible digital use
Consumer awareness about scams and the methods of scammers has shown
promise for increasing people’s ability to avoid them. For example, a study in
Uganda that employed interactive games, delivered through interactive voice
response, to teach people about fraud decreased the shares of both women and
men falling for scams.2
2 Mazer et al. (2025).
Digital safety and responsible use 61
There has also been increased attention to the risks of technology-facilitated
violence, which includes online bullying, offensive messages, doxing, and sharing
doctored photos. Though the Global Findex 2025 Digital Connectivity Tracker shows
that a relatively small share of people experience such harassment, any level is
unacceptable. International efforts to address issues surrounding such violence
include the UN’s Global Digital Compact, which aims to establish principles for an
open, free, and secure digital future that respects human rights. Complementary
efforts at the national level may span multiple domains. Globally, only 53 out of 190
economies reviewed in one study impose criminal penalties for offenses associated
with cyberharassment.3 Legal frameworks must evolve to recognize online
harassment and treat it with the same seriousness as physical harassment. At the
same time, tailored training programs in digital literacy for vulnerable populations—
particularly women, adolescent girls, and marginalized communities—can help
build preventive capacity by teaching users to recognize warning signs and employ
privacy-enhancing settings on their mobile phones. Finally, accessible, confidential
reporting channels with transparent processes for handling cases can enable victims
to seek help without stigma.
Users in all regions are moving from connectivity to inclusion
The view provided by the Global Findex 2025 Digital Connectivity Tracker highlights
the ways that people who own a mobile phone and SIM card and use the internet
are taking advantage of opportunities to communicate, access information, and
earn an income. Digital channels have also become essential for accessing and
using financial services to fulfill daily needs, pursue goals, and manage risk. The
next section explores these topics, starting with an overview of the current state of
financial account ownership.

The World Bank’s Identification for Development (ID4D) Initiative partners with the
Global Findex team to collect data on worldwide ownership and use of government-
issued forms of identification (ID) as part of the Global Findex survey.1 ID is often
a prerequisite for accessing and using digital services and for transacting with
governments, financial institutions, medical providers, educational institutions, and
other entities that handle personal information.2
Across low- and middle-income economies, 95 percent of adults have ID. Ownership
of ID is nearly universal across regions except for Sub-Saharan Africa (refer to
figure S1.1.1).

Some countries in Sub-Saharan Africa have low rates of ID ownership
Though not universal in the region, ID is pervasive in most Sub-Saharan African
economies. In all four subregions of Sub-Saharan Africa, average ID ownership rates
exceed 70 percent among all adults, and only the West and East African regions
have statistically significant gender gaps in these rates (of 5 percentage points, on
average; refer to figure S1.1.2). Eight economies have ID ownership rates below
70 percent, however: the Republic of Congo, Guinea, Mozambique, Niger, Sierra
Leone, Tanzania, Togo, and Uganda.3
Examination of data from just the eight economies with ID rates below 70 percent
reveals that five of them have significant gender gaps in ID ownership (refer to
figure S1.1.3). In Guinea, for example, the rates are 42 percent of women versus
52 percent of men, and in Niger, 43 percent of women have ID, compared with
63 percent of men.
Figure S1.1.2 Even though eight economies in Sub-Saharan Africa have low
rates of ID ownership, average rates among both women and men exceed
70 percent in all four subregions

3 Data for Chad and Liberia have been suppressed because of possible misinterpretation of the question as
referring to other acceptable forms of ID that could fulfill a similar purpose. This issue is particularly relevant in
these two economies, where new ID systems are being introduced while older systems remain in use.

ID matters for connectivity and accessing financial services,
among other benefits
People without ID face challenges participating in important activities. Specifically,
people without ID often have difficulty buying SIM cards; participating in elections;
accessing financial services, government support, and medical care; and applying
for jobs.
In six of the eight Sub-Saharan African economies with low rates of ID ownership,
the largest share of adults without ID cited having difficulty buying SIM cards.4 In
the Republic of Congo, 58 percent of adults without ID experienced this challenge; in
Guinea, 57 percent did; in Tanzania, 67 percent did; and in Uganda, 79 percent did. Put
another way, at least one in four adults in each of these economies was unable to buy
and register a SIM card in their own name (refer to figure S1.1.4). This directly affects
their ability to own and use a mobile phone and related digital services.
4 Respondents were able to choose multiple responses to the survey question.

Challenges in buying and registering SIM cards are just the beginning for people
who lack ID, however. They also find it difficult to participate in elections. In Guinea
and Uganda, one in five adults said they face this problem.
For people in Sub-Saharan Africa without ID, access to financial services is also
uncertain. Across the eight low-ID economies, a third of adults without ID report that
their lack of ID makes it difficult for them to use financial services. In Uganda, about
half of adults without ID report having this difficulty. This aligns with Global Findex
2025 data showing that 15 percent of adults without an account in Sub-Saharan
Africa do not have a mobile money account because they lack the documentation
they would need to open one.
Finally, some adults without ID say that they have had problems accessing
government support, applying for jobs, or accessing medical care. Across all low-
ID economies except Sierra Leone and Tanzania, about a quarter or more of adults
with no ID had difficulty accessing government services as a result. In the Republic
of Congo, Guinea, Mozambique, and Uganda, more than 30 percent of adults
without ID—generally between 10 and 15 percent of all adults in these economies—
faced difficulties applying for a job. More than 20 percent of adults without ID found
it challenging to access medical care in Guinea, Mozambique, Niger, and Uganda.
Why don’t people have ID?
The process of applying for government ID requires people to travel to the nearest
location where registration services are offered; they must bring documentation
supporting their identity, such as a birth certificate, which can be difficult to obtain;
they may have to pay a fee for ID and cover travel costs for the trip; and they risk either
lost wages as a result of taking time away from work or challenges arising from leaving
their domestic duties. Each of these factors creates a barrier to accessing ID.
When the Global Findex asked people without ID why they don’t have it, three of
these barriers came up most often in the eight economies in Sub-Saharan Africa
with low rates of ID ownership: getting ID is too expensive, the distance to travel to
obtain ID is too great, or they lack the supporting documentation they would need
to get ID. Smaller but statistically significant shares of adults without ID say they use
another form of ID instead, such as a voter card or a birth registration certificate, do
not need ID, or are uncomfortable with sharing their personal information to get ID.
Different barriers dominate in different economies (refer to figure S1.1.5). At least
half of adults without ID in Guinea, Mozambique, and Sierra Leone say getting ID is
too expensive. Half or more in Guinea, Mozambique, Niger, and Sierra Leone say it
is too far to travel to get ID. More than 60 percent in Guinea and Togo say they lack
the necessary documentation.

What approaches can facilitate increased ID access?
Successful approaches to facilitating greater access to ID consider both the services
that they want to enable and the barriers people face. For example, reducing travel
time to get ID and streamlining the registration process can lower associated costs
and particularly benefit the people most likely not to have ID, such as women and
rural residents.
Access to ID is essential, but equally important is ensuring that ID systems are
trustworthy, effectively managed, and designed to safeguard individuals’ rights and
data while supporting development goals. Possession of ID does not necessarily
mean people have access to high-quality ID systems, indicating that coverage alone
should not be the primary focus for those working on ID and civil registration.5

systems, visit the World Bank’s ID4D web page at http://id4d.worldbank.org.

2.1 A ccount ownership
Accounts are the cornerstone of financial access and the foundation of financial
inclusion. They provide people with a safe way to store money and build savings
for the future; they also help them make and receive payments or receive loan
disbursements. Account ownership is associated with multiple positive development
outcomes for both account owners and the broader economy, including increased
consumption,1 reduced poverty,2 elevated productivity,3 higher savings levels,4 and
greater ability to share resources.5
Worldwide, 79 percent of adults have an account either at a bank or similar financial
institution such as a credit union, microfinance institution, or post office or through
a mobile money provider (refer to box 2.1.1). Rates of account ownership vary widely
across economies, however (refer to map 2.1.1). Among the 139 economies included
in Global Findex 2025, account ownership ranges from just 15 percent in Niger, a
low-income and fragile and conflict-affected economy, to universal in such high-
income economies as Canada, Japan, and the Netherlands.
Box 2.1.1 Account ownership defined
Global Findex 2025 defines “account ownership” as having an account at a bank or
similar institution such as a credit union, microfinance institution, or post office,
or with a mobile money provider that is included in the GSMA’s Mobile Money
Deployment Tracker.a Owners can use these accounts at a minimum to store money
and to send and receive payments.
The Global Findex 2025 collected data separately for accounts at these two types of
providers and uses the following definitions:
• Adults with an account at a bank or similar financial institution refers to adults
with an individual or jointly owned account at a regulated institution such as a
bank or similar financial institution. Such institutions have historically maintained
a physical footprint in the form of branch locations. This category also includes
adults who say they have a debit card linked to an account, even if they say they
do not have an account at a bank or similar financial institution.

83
Box 2.1.1 Account ownership defined (continued)
A subcategory of “digitally enabled” account at a bank or similar financial institution
allows the account owner to make or receive payments using a card or phone.
Each economy identifies the banks and financial institutions that offer transaction
accounts and are subject to prudential regulation by a government authority. This
category excludes accounts with mobile money providers as well as those with nonbank
financial institutions, such as pension funds and retirement accounts, and with
other nonbank financial institutions like insurance companies and brokerage firms.
• Adults with a mobile money account refers to adults who have personally used a
mobile phone in the preceding 12 months to make payments, purchase goods or
services, or send or receive money and have also used a mobile money provider
included in the GSMA Mobile Money Deployment Tracker. The GSMA’s tracker
includes telecom- and fintech-led platforms that offer financial services via mobile
phones and typically operate independently of traditional banks. This group
generally excludes adults using digital wallets that function primarily as app-based
payment tools. Some mobile money account providers listed in the GSMA’s tracker,
however, could be legally licensed as a bank or are typically supported by a bank
partner, or some of their services could be linked to bank accounts, although they
can also be used without a traditional bank account. All mobile money accounts are
by definition digitally enabled, and are primarily accessed through mobile phones.
The total account ownership rate includes respondents who said no when asked if they
had an account or debit card yet also reported that they had received wages, government
transfers, public sector pensions, or payments for the sale of agricultural products in
an account in the preceding 12 months or that they had paid utility bills directly from
an account at a bank or similar financial institution in the preceding 12 months. Among
low- and middle-income economies, this adds 2 percent of respondents to the share of
adults with an account; each of these respondents is added to the share of adults with
the type of account they say they used to receive or make the relevant payment (that is,
an account at a bank or similar financial institution or a mobile money account).
For most high-income economies and the Russian Federation, the Global Findex 2025
included only questions on account ownership, not questions that resulted in these
additions. In Algeria, China, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Libya, Mauritius, and Ukraine,
an abridged form of the questionnaire was administered by phone. As a result, account
ownership in these economies may be underestimated, because the questionnaire did
not include all relevant questions. The “Methodology” tab of the Global Findex website
(http://globalfindex.worldbank.org) provides details on the information collected in
each surveyed economy.

The data show significant differences in account ownership rates across economies
in the same income group (refer to figure 2.1.1). For example, among low-income
economies, account ownership ranges from 15 percent in Niger to 73 percent in
Uganda. Among high-income economies, Panama has the lowest account ownership
rate, at 64 percent. Thailand has the highest account ownership rate among upper-
middle-income economies, at 92 percent. In lower-middle-income economies,
account ownership ranges from 23 percent in Lebanon to 98 percent in Mongolia.6
6 Mongolia’s near-universal Child Money Programme drives the economy’s high rate of account ownership.
The program, introduced in 2005, provides a monthly allowance for every child under the age of 18, which the
Mongolian government deposits directly into an account.
Account ownership 85
Account ownership increased by 28 percentage points, or more
than 50 percent, worldwide between 2011 and 2024
In 2024, the global account ownership rate stood at 79 percent, a 28 percentage point
increase from the worldwide average of 51 percent in 2011, when the first round of
Global Findex data was collected (refer to figure 2.1.2). Account ownership increased
in both high-income and low- and middle-income economies, but the average growth
rate in the latter group of economies was steeper. Account ownership is nearly
universal in most high-income economies, yet nevertheless increased for this group
by 7 percentage points, from 87 percent in 2011 to 95 percent in 2024.7 In low- and
middle-income economies, account ownership grew by 34 percentage points, from
42 percent in 2011 to 75 percent in 2024, an 80 percent increase.
Despite the large increase overall, account ownership grew at different rates in
individual economies between 2011 and 2024 (refer to figure 2.1.3). For instance, it
grew by about 70 percentage points in both the Kyrgyz Republic and Senegal over this
period. This is twice the average increase for low- and middle-income economies and
by far the largest increase among economies in this income group, albeit from 2011
account ownership percentages in the single digits.

7 The Global Findex reports data as whole percentage points, although it calculates that whole based on rounding
up or down from the tenths place. As such, any discrepancies between the reported size of a gap and the
difference between its end points is due to rounding.
86 The Global Findex Database 2025
Other economies, however, experienced much smaller increases. In 16 economies
that were at or below the global average of 51 percent in 2011, account
ownership grew by 20 percentage points or less between 2011 and 2024. This
includes six economies in which it grew by 10 percentage points or less.

An additional 18 economies also experienced double-digit increases in account
ownership, each gaining between 10 and 20 percentage points during this period:

Mobile money has spread from Sub-Saharan Africa around the world and
increased total account ownership
Motivated by the growing impact of mobile money on financial inclusion, since 2014
the Global Findex survey has asked respondents about their use of mobile money
services, in addition to their use of accounts at a bank or similar financial institution
(refer to map 2.1.2). In 2014, just 2 percent of adults globally had a mobile money
account. As of 2024, that share had increased to 15 percent globally and 18 percent
in low- and middle-income economies (refer to figure 2.1.4).8

Sub-Saharan Africa continues to have the highest rate of mobile money account
ownership of any world region, at 40 percent of adults. Sub-Saharan Africa is
no longer the only world region enjoying high rates of mobile money account
ownership, however. In Latin America and the Caribbean, 37 percent of adults have
a mobile money account (refer to figure 2.1.5). Compared with the rate in 2021,
mobile money account ownership had increased by 13 and 15 percentage points
in Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean, respectively, in 2024.
In South Asia, 22 percent of adults have a mobile money account, a 10 percentage
point increase since 2021.
Yet Sub-Saharan Africa still stands out for having a large share of adults with only a
mobile money account. A third of the region’s account owners—20 percent of adults—
have no other kind of account. In all other regions, less than 5 percent of all adults
and less than 6 percent of account owners have only a mobile money account.
Notwithstanding mobile money’s growth, accounts at banks or similar financial
institutions remain the most common type of account for adults in low- and middle-
income economies. In that group of countries, 57 percent of adults have only an
account at a bank or similar financial institution, and 14 percent have both an
account at a bank or similar financial institution and a mobile money account.

Almost half of adults in low- and middle-income economies have a
digitally enabled account
A mobile money account is not the only way to use financial services with a mobile
phone. Many adults who have only an account at a bank or similar financial institution,
and not a mobile money account, make payments from their account using a card or
app on a mobile phone, which means their accounts are digitally enabled. Since mobile
money accounts are also by definition digitally enabled, more than half of adults in
low- and middle-income economies today have a digitally enabled account.
In Latin America and the Caribbean and Sub-Saharan Africa, most adults have a
digitally enabled account as a function of the fact that they have mobile money
accounts. In East Asia and Pacific, Europe and Central Asia, and the Middle East and
North Africa, however, accessing an account at a bank or similar financial institution
using a card or mobile phone is more common than using mobile money (refer to
figure 2.1.6). South Asia is the only region where fewer than half of account owners
have a digitally enabled account.

The role of mobile money accounts in Sub-Saharan Africa
In Sub-Saharan Africa, mobile money rather than traditional banks or similar
financial institutions increasingly drives account ownership. The region is home
to all 19 world economies in which more banked adults have only a mobile money
account than have an account at a bank or similar financial institution: Benin,
Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Republic of
Congo, Côte d’Ivoire, Gabon, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali,
Mozambique, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. In 2014,
mobile money accounts were concentrated in the economies of East Africa. Since
then, however, mobile money has spread to economies in West Africa and beyond
(refer to map 2.1.3). In 2024, average mobile money account ownership in each of
the four subregions of Sub-Saharan Africa—Central, East, Southern, and West—was
about 40 percent (refer to figure 2.1.7).9
9 Subregions here are as defined by the African Union.

Account ownership 95
Account ownership gaps are narrowing, but not everywhere and
not for everyone
Not all groups have benefited equally from growth in account ownership since
2011. Although progress continues, women, the poor, the young, the less educated,
people who are out of the workforce, and people living in rural environments
remain less likely than men, the rich, older adults, educated adults, those in the
workforce, and urban residents to have an account (refer to figure 2.1.8).10

Account ownership has increased among both men and women, and the
gender gap has narrowed
Globally, 81 percent of men and 77 percent of women have accounts—representing
a gender gap of 4 percentage points (refer to figure 2.1.8, panel a). Low- and
middle-income economies show a similar gender gap, at 5 percentage points, with
78 percent of men and 73 percent of women having an account. Although account
ownership increased among both men and women between 2021 and 2024, the
gender gaps remained the same, despite narrowing from 9 percentage points
globally and 10 percentage points in low- and middle-income economies between
2011 and 2024 (refer to figure 2.1.9, panel a).11
11 The 9 percentage point gap is a legacy of how the World Bank Group categorized the world’s economies by
income group in 2011. Some economies have graduated to high-income status since the first round of data
collection. Global Findex 2025 uses the World Bank’s fiscal year 2024 income classification for all rounds of data
to ensure consistency of group composition for aggregate averages. If the fiscal year 2024 income classification
were applied to 2011 data, the 2011 gap would instead be 10 percentage points.

Account ownership particularly benefits women beyond the general positive
development outcomes mentioned at the opening of this section. Women with
accounts are better able to exert control over their finances and household
expenditures and have increased control over their earnings. This helps shift gender
norms in their favor.12
Sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East and North Africa continued in 2024 to report
gender gaps of 12 and 15 percentage points, respectively—more than twice the
average for low- and middle-income economies. In contrast, the gender gap in East
Asia and Pacific is not statistically significant. Latin America and the Caribbean and
Europe and Central Asia each have gender gaps of 8 percentage points.
The data also reflect appreciable differences within regions. South Asia is a case
in point. India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka have gender gaps that are not statistically
significant. But gender gaps in Bangladesh (20 percentage points) and Pakistan
(30 percentage points) are four or more times greater than the global gender gap.

98 The Global Findex Database 2025
On average, high-income economies do not have statistically significant gender
gaps in account ownership, because account ownership is nearly universal in these
economies.
In Sub-Saharan Africa, mobile money accounts have made access more equal
among men and women
The spread of mobile money has been touted as creating new opportunities to
better serve financially underserved groups, such as women and poor people.13
A closer look at Sub-Saharan Africa—the only region with economies in which
20 percent or more of adults have only a mobile money account—shows that
ownership of only a mobile money account has increased among both men and
women. Whereas on average Sub-Saharan Africa has a gender gap of 11 percentage
points in ownership of accounts at a financial institution—that is, among people
who have either an account at a bank or similar financial institution or both such an
account and a mobile money account—there is no significant gender gap among
adults who have only a mobile money account. This finding holds in the three
economies outside of Sub-Saharan Africa in which more than 10 percent of adults
have only a mobile money account: Colombia, Paraguay, and the Philippines.
The income gap in account ownership remains, despite increases in account
ownership among all adults
Poorer adults around the world are less likely than wealthier ones to have
an account. Among adults in the wealthiest 60 percent of households within
economies, 83 percent worldwide have an account, compared with 72 percent
among those in the poorest 40 percent of households within economies (refer
to figure 2.1.8, panel b). That represents an income gap of 11 percentage points.
This gap was wider in 2024 than it was in 2021, although it was lower than the
15 percentage point gap in 2011. The current level is comparable to that in 2017.
In low- and middle-income economies, the income gap is 12 percentage points,
similarly up from that in 2021 but again comparable to that in 2017 and down from
the same measurement in 2011 (refer to figure 2.1.9, panel b).
Some regions and economies have larger account ownership income gaps. Latin
America and the Caribbean and Sub-Saharan Africa have gaps that are larger
than average, at 17 percentage points and 18 percentage points, respectively.
At 37 percentage points—triple the average for low- and middle-income
economies—Viet Nam has the largest income gap in the world. Account ownership
grew between 2011 and 2024 for adults both in the wealthiest 60 percent and in
13 G20 and GPFI (2020).
Account ownership 99
the poorest 40 percent of Vietnamese households. The growth rate for adults in
the wealthiest 60 percent far outstripped that for adults in the poorest 40 percent,
however, resulting in an income gap that widened from 17 percentage points in
2011 to 37 percentage points in 2024.
Meanwhile, the gap in account ownership between adults in richer and poorer
households in high-income economies is not statistically significant, on average,
because account ownership is nearly universal in these economies. There are some
exceptions, however. In 10 high-income economies, the income gap in account
ownership is in the double digits. It is as large as 31 percentage points in Panama
and 27 percentage points in Romania.
Account ownership differs by age group
Account ownership is higher among older adults—that is, those ages 25 and up—
than among younger adults (those between the ages of 15 and 24).14 Worldwide,
81 percent of older adults have an account, but just 69 percent of younger adults
do, for a gap of 12 percentage points (refer to figure 2.1.8, panel c). This gap has
narrowed slightly since 2011, when it was 17 percentage points. The gap’s size and
trend are similar for both high-income and low- and middle-income economies.
The account ownership age gap shows some regional variations. At 15 percentage
points, the average age gap in the Middle East and North Africa and Sub-Saharan
Africa is about twice the average age gap in other regions. Notably, these two
regions have a large share of young adults, with a quarter and a third of their
adults, respectively, falling into the younger age bracket.
Gaps in ownership of accounts at banks or similar financial institutions are driving
the age gaps in these two regions. In Sub-Saharan Africa, where 20 percent of
all adults have only a mobile money account, there is no age gap among those
with only a mobile money account. And in economies such as the Republic of
Congo, Ghana, and Kenya, the gaps in account ownership at banks or similar
financial institutions are the reverse of the age gaps among those who have only
mobile money accounts; as a result, overall the gap in account ownership in these
economies is not statistically significant. To illustrate, in Kenya, 48 percent of
older adults have an account at a bank or similar financial institution, compared
with 41 percent of younger adults, for an age gap of 7 percentage points.
14 Some countries restrict account ownership to ages 21 and above.
100 The Global Findex Database 2025
Meanwhile, just 42 percent of older adults have only a mobile money account,
compared with 49 percent of younger adults, for a similar age gap of 7 percentage
points, but in the other direction.
Account ownership also varies by educational attainment
Among less-educated adults—those who have a primary education or less—
account ownership is lower than among adults with at least a secondary education
(refer to figure 2.1.8, panel d). In low- and middle-income economies, the gap in
account ownership between those two groups is 13 percentage points. This gap
was 17 percentage points in 2011, so it has narrowed over the years. Less-educated
adults are also more likely to be poor, which may help explain the gap.
At 31 percentage points, Sub-Saharan Africa is the region with the largest gap
in account ownership between less- and more-educated adults. There are wide
variations, however, in the account ownership education gap across the region’s
economies. In Ethiopia and Nigeria—the Sub-Saharan-African economies with the
largest gaps, both at about 38 percentage points—adults with more education
are almost twice as likely to have an account as adults with less education. Kenya’s
education gap of 13 percentage points is one of the smallest in the region and in
line with the average for all low- and middle-income economies.
Workforce participation correlates with account ownership
Adults who are active in the labor force—whether employed for wages or self-
employed or looking for work—are more likely to have an account than those who
are out of the labor force. Globally, 80 percent of adults who are active in the labor
force have an account, whereas just 67 percent of adults out of the labor force have
one (refer to figure 2.1.8, panel e). This results in a gap of 13 percentage points.
(These data exclude China, for which employment status data are not available.)
The gap is similar in low- and middle-income economies, but smaller by about half
in high-income economies. The average gap in labor force participation is similar
across regions, although there are appreciable differences across economies
within regions. Again, South Asia is a case in point. At 6 percentage points, India’s
gap is an outlier and similar to those in high-income economies. If data for India
are excluded, South Asia’s average gap increases from 16 percentage points to
24 percentage points; Pakistan has the largest gap in the region at 29 percentage
points.
Account ownership 101
An urban-rural gap in account ownership exists, but it is hard to
quantify precisely
In low- and middle-income economies, in which account ownership is not yet
universal or even close to it, account ownership is generally lower in rural areas
than in urban areas (refer to figure 2.1.8, panel f). But quantifying the urban-
rural gap precisely proves difficult. The distinction could be based on factors such
as population density, on the presence and availability of certain services and
infrastructure, or on the subjective judgment of interviewers or respondents.
Definitional issues of this type become more challenging across economies. What
might be considered rural in some economies, for example, might be considered
urban in less densely populated economies. The Gallup World Poll—the survey to
which the Global Findex survey questionnaire is added—distinguishes between rural
and urban areas based on population grids15 (sometimes, but not usually, informed
by local administrative units) that directly capture the spatial concentration of
people, instead of relying on respondents’ or interviewers’ perceptions to classify
residences. The Global Findex Database 2025 uses the Gallup World Poll definition
to provide account ownership averages for adults living in rural and urban areas.16
In low- and middle-income economies, 79 percent of adults living in urban areas
have accounts versus 71 percent of those living in rural areas. Sub-Saharan Africa
has the largest urban–rural gap: 70 percent of adults in urban areas have an account,
compared with 52 percent of adults in rural areas, for a gap of 17 percentage points.
However, gaps vary widely by economies within regions. The two economies with
the largest urban–rural gaps in the world, incidentally, are outside of Sub-Saharan
Africa: Moldova in Europe and Central Asia has a gap of 32 percentage points, and
Cambodia in East Asia and Pacific has a gap of 31 percentage points. Consistent with
determinants of other gaps, accounts at banks or similar institutions drive the urban-
rural gap in Sub-Saharan Africa. The region shows no urban–rural gap among adults
who have only mobile money accounts.
Reaching those who remain without accounts
The increases in account ownership since the Global Findex 2021 survey, driven by
mobile money and other digital enablers, are a testament to the positive impact
of financial inclusion efforts and digital connectivity. Yet the challenge of ensuring
everyone who can benefit has access to an account for storing money and making
and receiving payments has not yet been fully met. Worldwide, 1.3 billion adults are
still unbanked. The next section explores who they are and what barriers they face.
15 For additional information, see OECD and EC (2020).
16 For economies in which face-to-face surveys were conducted for the Global Findex 2021 survey, account
ownership among adults living in urban and rural areas is available for 2021.

2.2 Expanding access to financial accounts
Around the world, people increasingly have financial accounts. Though nearly half
of adults lacked such accounts in 2011, and 26 percent did in 2021, that number had
fallen to just 21 percent in 2024. Despite this progress, 1.3 billion adults worldwide
still lack financial accounts and are thus unable to benefit directly from the formal
financial system.
As account ownership continues to grow, those who remain without accounts are
disproportionately more likely to be women or poor or to have no more than a
primary school education, making them more vulnerable and difficult to reach than
the general population.1
To provide a better understanding of adults without accounts and how best to reach
them, the Global Findex 2024 survey asked questions that explored where they live,
who they are, the barriers they face to account ownership, their readiness to use
accounts, and opportunities to expand account ownership (refer to box 2.2.1).
Box 2.2.1 Defining adults without accounts and clarifying survey
approaches
Global Findex 2025 defines account ownership as having an account at a bank
or similar financial institution such as a credit union, microfinance institution, or
post office or with a mobile money service included in the GSMA’s Mobile Money
Deployment Tracker.a Such an account can be used at a minimum to store money
safely and to send and receive payments. Adults without an account do not have
an individual or jointly owned account at a bank or similar financial institution or
a mobile money provider. Refer to chapter 2.1 for a detailed definition of account
ownership.
In all regions excluding Sub-Saharan Africa, the Global Findex survey asked adults
without an account about the barriers they faced to having an account at a bank or
similar financial institution. In Sub-Saharan Africa, adults without an account were
instead asked questions on the barriers they faced to having a mobile money account.
In Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Nigeria, and the Philippines, adults without an account were
asked both sets of questions. Summary statistics for both barriers to bank and similar
financial institution accounts and barriers to mobile money accounts are shown as
percentages of adults without an account at any financial institution.
(Box continued next page)

105
Box 2.2.1 Defining adults without accounts and clarifying survey
approaches (continued)
Summary statistics on adults without accounts include all economies. Data for some
low- and middle-income economies with account ownership rates above 89 percent—
China, India, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Kenya, Malaysia, Mauritius, Mongolia,
and Thailand—have been excluded from calculations related to barriers to account
ownership and other questions asked only of adults without accounts, because
the sample sizes in these economies are too small to be nationally representative.
However, since India has a sample larger than 3,000 respondents (the only country in
this group that does), the responses of adults in India without accounts are reported
separately.
For most high-income economies and the Russian Federation, the Global Findex 2024
survey included only questions on account ownership. The “Methodology” tab of the
Global Findex website (http://globalfindex.worldbank.org) provides details on the
information collected in each surveyed economy.
a. The tracker is available at https://www.gsma.com/mobile-money-metrics/#deployment-tracker.
Most adults without accounts live in just eight economies
Adults in high-income economies enjoy near-universal account ownership. Most
adults without accounts live, in contrast, in low- and middle-income economies, and
53 percent of them—more than 650 million adults—reside in just eight: Bangladesh,
China, the Arab Republic of Egypt, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria, and Pakistan
(refer to figure 2.2.1).2
A large-population economy can have a high rate of account ownership and still
be home to many people without accounts. For instance, both China and India
have account ownership rates of nearly 90 percent, yet they are also home to the
largest number of adults without accounts. Other economies in the list, such as
Bangladesh, Egypt, and Pakistan, have large populations but account ownership
rates of about 50 percent.
Global Findex 2025 finds that in 29 economies included in the 2024 survey, fewer
than half of adults have an account. Ten of these economies are fragile or affected
by conflict, and 24 are low or lower middle income.
2 These eight countries represent 51 percent of the global population.
106 The Global Findex Database 2025
The five countries with the largest number of adults without accounts have
remained the same since 2011, despite significant increases in account ownership in
some of them, such as India.3

Expanding access to financial accounts 107
Adults without accounts are more likely to be women, poor,
and young
Understanding who adults without accounts are can help inform targeted policies
to expand account access. Adults without accounts are disproportionately likely to
come from more vulnerable or disenfranchised populations (refer to figure 2.2.2).
Cross-country regression analysis of Global Findex 2025 data confirms that women,
lower-income, less educated, younger, and more rural adults are disproportionately
less likely to have accounts. Specifically, Global Findex 2025 finds that of the
1.3 billion adults globally without accounts:
• More than 700 million (55 percent) are women.
• 670 million (52 percent) are from the poorest 40 percent of households by income.
• 790 million (62 percent) have a primary education or less.
• 690 million (54 percent) are either out of the workforce or unemployed.
• 380 million (29 percent) are ages 15–24, another 590 million (46 percent) are ages 25–54,
and 320 million (25 percent) are ages 55 and older.
Men and women in East Asia and Pacific are equally likely to not have an account,
whereas Europe and Central Asia has the largest share of women without
accounts at 61 percent (refer to figure 2.2.2, panel a). Türkiye largely drives this
high percentage, as it is the second-most-populous economy in the region, and
77 percent of its adults without accounts are women.
By income level, adults without accounts in East Asia and the Pacific, at 58 percent,
are disproportionately among the poorest 40 percent in their economies (refer to

without accounts, respectively, live in the poorest 40 percent of households. These
are the highest and third-highest rates, respectively, in the world.
Adults without accounts also differ in respect to employment status.4 Across low-
and middle-income economies, 47 percent of adults without accounts are out of
the workforce, whereas 20 percent are wage employed, and 27 percent are self-
employed. Different interventions may be necessary to encourage adults in each
of these groups to open and use an account. For instance, adults who receive
formal wages could benefit from efforts to digitalize wages, whereas some adults
who are out of the workforce might be better reached by digitalizing pensions or
government transfers.

Expanding access to financial accounts 109
The connection between educational attainment and account access in a region
is highly dependent on overall education rates across that region. When the focus
is South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, the regions with the largest percentage
of adults with a primary education or less, 71 percent and 74 percent of adults
without an account, respectively, have a primary education or less. Efforts to
expand account ownership to adults in this group must consider that they could
be disproportionately vulnerable to fraud and might struggle to use an account
independently, pointing to the importance of financial education and fraud
protection appropriately designed across income- and education-level segments.
Not having enough money is the main barrier to bank account ownership
To provide a better understanding of barriers to account ownership, the Global
Findex 2025 asked respondents without accounts at a bank or similar institution
why they did not have one. Economies with greater than 89 percent account
ownership (China, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Malaysia, Mongolia, and Thailand)
were excluded from regional barrier calculations because the samples of adults
without accounts were too small to be nationally representative. Data for India
are not included in the South Asia average because of the economy’s high account
ownership rate but are instead reported separately (refer to box 2.2.1). Respondents
in most economies in Sub-Saharan Africa (excluding Ethiopia and Nigeria) were not
asked questions about bank account ownership but instead answered an alternative
set of questions about why they did not have a mobile money account (discussed
later in the chapter).
In answering the question, respondents could choose from a set of six barriers:
• They do not have enough money.
• Fees for financial services are too high.
• A family member already has an account.
• Financial institutions are too far away.
• They do not trust institutions.
• They lack necessary documentation.
It was possible to select more than one of these barriers, and most respondents
did so (refer to figure 2.2.3).

account ownership in East Asia and Pacific, the Middle East and North Africa,

Note: Respondents could choose more than one reason. Respondents in Sub-Saharan Africa without
accounts answered an alternative set of questions about the barriers they face to mobile money account
ownership. Economies with greater than 89 percent account ownership (China, India, the Islamic Republic of
Iran, Malaysia, Mongolia, and Thailand) have been excluded from regional averages calculated.
and South Asia, as well as in both Ethiopia and Nigeria in Sub-Saharan Africa.
Across regions, most adults who cited a lack of money as an obstacle listed it in
addition to other reasons. Among individual economies, Egypt has the highest
share of adults without an account saying a lack of money is the reason why, at
90 percent; for half of them, it was the only barrier they selected. Adults who believe
they lack the money for an account may not be able to maintain minimum balances
required to avoid service fees or may have so little money that they think an account
is not worthwhile. Adults who cited a lack of money as an obstacle might also
perceive themselves as too poor to visit a branch and use bank services.
The fees for financial services are the barrier adults without accounts cited next most
commonly across almost all regions. These fees might include those for opening
and maintaining an account (such as those paid monthly), as well as costs for
transactions (such as checking balances, making withdrawals, and sending money).
This barrier is most pervasive in Latin America and the Caribbean, where 57 percent
Expanding access to financial accounts 111
of adults without accounts highlighted it. Account fees are also a common barrier
in East Asia and Pacific and in South Asia, where more than 40 percent of adults
without accounts named them; 24 percent did in the Middle East and North Africa. In
Nigeria, 22 percent of adults without accounts reported the cost of financial services
as a barrier. These findings highlight the potential demand for more affordable
accounts, including mobile money accounts, which may have lower fees.
Using a family member’s account comes next among reasons people gave for not
owning a personal account. Research underscores the benefits of having a personal
account in regard to women’s privacy and control over their own money,5 and adults
who share an account are already familiar with financial products, which could
facilitate adoption. In Europe and Central Asia, having a family member with an
account was the most frequently cited barrier to account ownership; more than half
of adults without accounts highlighted it. Women without accounts in the region were
21 percentage points more likely than men to point to a family member’s account as
a reason for not having their own. Relying on a family member’s account could be
driven by several factors, including differences in labor force participation and digital
receipt of wages, as well as the cost for a family to have multiple accounts.
Distance to the nearest financial institution is the next most commonly cited barrier.
More than 40 percent of rural residents without bank accounts highlighted the
challenge of distance, unsurprisingly. This issue is also more prevalent in East Asia
and Pacific and Latin America and the Caribbean, where about 40 percent of adults
without an account cited it, than in other regions. Distance is the second most
frequently cited barrier for adults without accounts in Ethiopia and Nigeria, where
30 percent and 47 percent of these adults highlighted it, respectively. Mobile money
and fintech products that leverage local agent networks can help reduce the burden
of traveling long distances to access financial services, especially in areas with high
rates of mobile phone ownership.
Finally, a lack of trust in financial institutions dissuades about 20 percent of adults
without accounts across low- and middle-income economies and roughly a third of
adults without accounts in Latin America and the Caribbean from having accounts.
In Nigeria, 25 percent of adults without accounts mentioned trust as an issue. This
concern was often mentioned alongside the high costs of financial services. For
instance, about 20 percent of adults without accounts in Latin America and the
Caribbean mentioned both concerns. Trust may be related to the perceived safety
of keeping money in an account, as well as to understanding and anticipating
service fees. This further highlights the importance of targeted and appropriate

financial education, as well as appropriate consumer protection measures, including
transparent pricing and terms and conditions, effective handling of complaints and
mechanisms for redress, and adequate fraud and cybersecurity protections.
Though India has a 90 percent account ownership rate, its large population means
it still has among the largest number of adults without accounts of any economy
in the world. The large sample size of Global Findex 2024 survey respondents in
India yields results with a high enough degree of statistical significance to allow the
barriers to account ownership to be examined. Counter to what is the case in most
low- and middle-income economies, the most common reason in India for not having
an account is that a family member has one (refer to figure 2.2.4). The share of adults
giving this reason is notably higher than the share citing not having enough money
for an account, suggesting a potential unmet demand for personal accounts among
both men and women. The second-most-common barrier is not having enough
money, followed by the cost of financial services and financial institutions being too
far away; all three were cited by about half of adults in India without accounts.
Barriers to mobile money account ownership in Sub-Saharan Africa
For economies in Sub-Saharan Africa, the Global Findex 2025 asked why
adults without any type of account do not have mobile money. Concentrating on
barriers to mobile money in this region, rather than accounts at banks or similar
institutions, was both practical and methodological. On the practical side, mobile
money accounts are the most common and fastest-growing type of accounts
in most economies in the region (discussed in chapter 2.1). The exceptions are
Expanding access to financial accounts 113
Ethiopia and Nigeria, where banks dominate (and where the survey included both
the questions about barriers related to bank account ownership and those about
mobile money account ownership). The methodological argument relates to clarity
for respondents, who answer dozens of questions and often get confused or
impatient if asked to respond to what sound like the same questions twice.
Respondents could choose from the following five options:
• They don’t have enough money to use a mobile money account.
• They lack necessary documentation.
• Mobile money agents are too far away.
• Available mobile money products are too expensive.
• They worry about account safety.
The responses they gave for not having mobile money accounts reveal patterns
similar to those found with respect to the answers respondents in other regions
gave regarding banks (refer to figure 2.2.5).

114 The Global Findex Database 2025
Across Sub-Saharan Africa, not having enough money was the most frequently
cited barrier to mobile money account ownership, with 59 percent of adults without
accounts reporting it. This barrier’s prevalence varies by subregion, though it is
consistently an issue for at least half of adults without accounts in every subregion.
As is the case with barriers to bank account ownership, those who said a lack of
money is a barrier generally also named at least one other barrier.
Not having necessary documentation is the second-most-common barrier to
mobile money account ownership in the region. Depending on the account opening
due-diligence requirements for a given economy, the documentation could include
the applicant’s personal ID as well as some form of address verification, such as a
utility bill with their name on it. (Spotlight 1.1 at the end of section 1 provides more
information on the challenges people without IDs face in Sub-Saharan Africa.)
Distance to a mobile money agent is an issue for 28 percent of adults without
accounts. Although mobile money agents are more pervasive than commercial
banks in many of the region’s economies,6 it might still be difficult for some adults
to access them, especially in more remote areas. In Central Africa, this is an obstacle
for a little more than a third of adults, compared with 21 percent in Southern Africa.
The cost of mobile money products is a barrier for 23 percent of adults without
accounts, with limited subregional variation, though wide variation at the level of
individual economies: 47 percent of adults without accounts in Chad highlighted
costs, whereas just 8 percent did in The Gambia.
Research suggests that competition among mobile money agents could help reduce
the costs associated with mobile money accounts. Evidence from Ghana finds that
fees decrease after mobile agents enter local markets.7 Taxes on digital payment
services might also be increasing the cost of mobile money transactions, given
the existence of such taxes in many economies.8 In addition to formal costs on
transactions and withdrawals, mobile agents might also be overcharging customers;
this highlights the importance of agent oversight.9
Finally, 18 percent of adults without mobile money accounts worried about account
safety. The share of adults without an account who reported this as a barrier ranges
from 26 percent in Central Africa to 13 percent in East Africa (see chapter 1.3 for a
discussion of safe digital use).

Expanding access to financial accounts 115
Continued use of an account is not guaranteed, as some adults
without accounts previously owned one
Adults without a bank or similar financial institution account were also asked
whether they had previously owned one. In Europe and Central Asia, the Middle
East and North Africa, and South Asia, only 10 percent or less of adults without an
account at a bank or similar financial institution previously owned one. In East Asia
and Pacific, 15 percent of adults without an account at a bank or similar financial
institution previously had one; this share was 18 percent in Indonesia. In Latin
America and the Caribbean, nearly a quarter of adults without an account at a bank
or similar financial institution had an account in the past, a pattern consistent across
all economies in the region except Nicaragua.
These patterns might reflect perceived trade-offs between the benefits of having an
account and the associated costs, such as fees, bad service, or poorly designed or
inappropriate products that do not meet customer needs. The findings suggest that
policies to increase account ownership should focus not only on reducing barriers,
but also on improving the customer experience and product design to support
continued account use and customer retention.
Digital readiness can help increase account ownership in
Sub-Saharan Africa
The massive impact that digital financial services have had on financial inclusion
over the past decade provides clear opportunities for reaching adults without
accounts. In Sub-Saharan Africa specifically, for example, 42 percent of all adults—
more than 300 million people—do not have accounts, the highest rate in the world.
Of the 50 economies around the world in Global Findex 2025 that have account
ownership rates lower than 60 percent, 21 of them are in Sub-Saharan Africa. Given
that mobile money accounts are the dominant type of account in the region and are
the source of most of the growth in account ownership, it is important to examine
what people without accounts might need to open one.
Opening a mobile money account in the region typically has three requirements:
personal ID and necessary documentation, a mobile phone, and a SIM card
registered in the phone owner’s name. (Only a small number of adults report
using a SIM card registered to someone else, as discussed in chapter 1.1.) These
requirements are sequential: to obtain SIM cards in their names, people must first
have personal IDs, and to open mobile money accounts, they must have SIM cards
registered in their names.
116 The Global Findex Database 2025
People without accounts who have identification and own both a mobile phone
and a SIM card registered in their name are digitally ready to become account
owners. Overall, about a quarter of adults without accounts in Sub-Saharan Africa
have all three prerequisites, making them digitally ready for mobile money account
ownership.
An important caveat is that the ecosystem for mobile money must also be
well developed to support mobile money users. This includes investments in
infrastructure, such as reliable mobile broadband and electricity, which allow
financial services to function consistently and reach rural or underserved areas.
A supportive regulatory environment is also important: clear financial regulations,
strong consumer protection frameworks, and mechanisms for dispute resolution
can build trust in the financial system, encouraging adoption and sustained use.
Finally, the private sector plays a central role in designing and offering financial
products that are relevant, affordable, and easy to use for people currently outside
the financial system. Without appropriate, user-friendly services, the infrastructure
alone will not translate into meaningful financial access.
With that caveat, across the region, two-thirds of adults without accounts have IDs,
and women are as likely as men to have them, potentially enabling them to easily
obtain a SIM card registered in their name. ID possession among adults without
accounts varies by subregion (refer to figure 2.2.6). In Central and East Africa,
73 percent and 75 percent of adults without accounts, respectively, have IDs; in
West Africa, on the other hand, just 58 percent do. As discussed in spotlight 1.1, in
eight Sub-Saharan African economies, less than 70 percent of people have IDs; four
of the countries are in West Africa. Government initiatives to expand ID ownership
have proven effective on this front.10
Regarding mobile phone ownership, just over half of adults without accounts in the
region have mobile phones, though there is substantial variation across subregions.
For example, whereas almost two-thirds of adults without accounts in West Africa
have mobile phones, less than half of adults without accounts in Central and East
Africa do. In Ethiopia, only 39 percent of adults without an account have mobile
phones. Men and women without accounts are equally likely to have mobile phones,
except in East Africa, where 50 percent of men without accounts have phones
compared with 37 percent of women.

Finally, about a third of adults without accounts in Sub-Saharan Africa have SIM
cards registered in their own names. SIM card ownership ranges from 20 percent or
less in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Madagascar, and Mozambique
to more than 70 percent in Botswana and Mauritania. Men and women without
118 The Global Findex Database 2025
accounts are equally likely to have SIM cards across Sub-Saharan Africa, with slight
variations in East and Southern Africa, where women are 7 and 5 percentage points
less likely, respectively, than men to have SIM cards registered in their own names.
Considering these foundations of digital readiness, there may be existing
opportunities to reach some adults without accounts in Sub-Saharan Africa,
particularly the 26 percent of them who have IDs, mobile phones, and their own SIM
cards. This group totals more than 80 million people, equal shares of them women
and men.
The biggest barrier to account ownership among digitally ready adults who
lack accounts but have mobile phones, IDs, and SIM cards is that they do not
have enough money. About half of them name that as a barrier, whereas about
20 percent cite each of the other barriers offered as responses to the survey
question, such as distance to an agent.
The share of digitally ready adults ranges from more than half of adults without
accounts in Botswana, Burkina Faso, and Namibia to a quarter or less of adults
without accounts in 14 other Sub-Saharan African economies. This variation in
readiness points to the importance of having economy-specific strategies to
promote financial inclusion. Some economies may be able to reach populations
without accounts by digitalizing payments, but others may first need to focus on
getting these adults mobile phones or personal IDs, registering their SIM cards, or
giving priority in policy making and budgets to supply-side foundations, such as
agent networks, cell towers, and other critical regulatory and physical infrastructure.
Smartphone ownership can help increase account ownership and
usage of accounts
As discussed in chapter 1.2, smartphones typically enable their owners to access
a wider range of digital services than basic phones do. In the context of financial
services, banking apps and those associated with mobile money accounts may
bring additional benefit by enabling real-time account monitoring and better user
experience and by offering features such as bill payments, money transfers, and
budgeting tools, enabling users to manage their finances more effectively. Some
mobile money providers also offer digital and financial literacy training via their
apps. These features and others enhance the benefit of smartphone ownership for
all financial account owners, including those with less financial experience. In all
regions except South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, more than half of adults without
accounts have a smartphone (refer to figure 2.2.7).

Demonstrating the benefits of use can motivate account adoption
Beyond being digitally ready, people who remain without accounts must also have
an incentive to access and use financial services if they are to be persuaded to open
and maintain accounts. Without convenient local entry points and compelling,
user-friendly financial services, adults without accounts may not find account
ownership worthwhile. The next section explores the Global Findex 2025 data on
using financial services, specifically saving, borrowing, and payments.

3.1 Saving
No matter what their end goals may be, people save money to have more options
for the future. They might want to invest in a child’s education or a family business,
fund their retirement, buy a home or pay for a larger purchase, or set aside
resources to address emergencies.
Global Findex 2025 examines saving as a behavior, not as a product. Specifically,
the survey asked respondents whether they saved or set aside any money in the
past year and whether they used a bank or mobile money account to do so or
saved alternatively through a semiformal method such as a savings club (refer to
box 3.1.1). The survey did not ask whether people used designated savings accounts
or savings products like certificates of deposit or how much they saved. As such, the
data do not provide insights on whether respondents held money for long enough
or saved a large enough balance to achieve a particular goal or build financial
resilience. People’s intentions to save and the actions they take are nonetheless
foundational for both long-term investments and financial health.
Overall, in low- and middle-income economies, 55 percent of adults saved in the
12 months before taking the survey, an increase of 12 percentage points since 2021.
The data show that more adults are saving in any way and more of them are formally
saving in an account at a bank or similar financial institution or by using a mobile
money account. In fact, the share of adults saving formally grew by 16 percentage
points between 2021 and 2024, more than the overall increase in saving.
The remainder of the chapter explores the different forms of saving and then
examines trends in formal saving.
Box 3.1.1 What it means to save formally and where the Global
Findex survey asked about it
The Global Findex 2025 defines “saving formally” as saving money in an account at
a bank or similar financial institution like a credit union, microfinance institution, or
post office, or by using a mobile money account included in the GSMA’s Mobile Money
Deployment Tracker (refer to box 2.1.1 for the full definition of accounts used by
Global Findex 2025).a The survey collected data regarding these two modes of formal
saving separately.b
For most high-income economies and the Russian Federation, the survey includes
only questions on account ownership, not questions on saving. As a result, this

Box 3.1.1 What it means to save formally and where the Global
Findex survey asked about it (continued)
chapter does not report global averages or those for high-income economies. In
Algeria, China, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Libya, Mauritius, and Ukraine, respondents
answered an abridged questionnaire and were surveyed by phone rather than in
person. The abridged questionnaire did not include a question on saving frequency.
The “Methodology” tab of the Global Findex website (http://globalfindex.worldbank
.org) provides details on the information collected in each surveyed economy.
a. The tracker is available at https://www.gsma.com/mobile-money-metrics/#deployment-tracker.
b. The Global Findex 2025 asked about saving using a mobile money provider only of adults who
have used a mobile money services provider included in the GSMA’s Mobile Money Deployment
Tracker and who live in economies in which mobile money accounts exist.
Most savers used an account
People save money in different ways. In low- and middle-income economies,
40 percent of adults—or 73 percent of those who saved any money in the past
year—saved formally in an account at a bank or similar financial institution or by
using a mobile money account (refer to map 3.1.1 and figure 3.1.1). Virtually all
adults who saved formally have their own account.1 As in 2021, formal saving is the
most common mode of saving in low- and middle-income economies.
Saving in an account lets owners store money privately and securely. Research
shows that having an account in which to save reduces reliance on borrowing,2
increases economic resilience3 and overall savings volumes,4 and lets users,
particularly women, reallocate household expenditures to better suit their needs.5
Alternatively, adults in low- and middle-income economies may save semiformally
through savings clubs or by leaving money with a person outside the family; this is
a common informal alternative to saving formally in an account. In 2024, 17 percent
of adults saved semiformally, including 6 percent of adults who saved only in
this way. An equal share of women and men saved semiformally, and a larger
share of wealthier adults did than poorer adults—19 percent versus 14 percent.
1 In low- and middle-income economies, 1 percent of adults who have saved formally lack an account of any type,
suggesting that they might use an account of another person in the household.

Saving semiformally is especially common as a share of saving in South Asia,
the only region where the share of adults saving semiformally grew between 2021
and 2024—from 8 percent to 13 percent of adults. It is also popular in Sub-Saharan
Africa, where 28 percent of adults saved semiformally in 2024, including 15 percent
who saved exclusively this way, about the same as in 2021; 31 percent of women
embraced this form of saving in the region compared with 25 percent of men.
Semiformal saving supports social networks and encourages people to build
regular saving habits to accumulate lump sums of money, but these savings are
also vulnerable to theft, lack flexibility regarding withdrawals, and do not earn
interest.6 For example, rotating savings and credit associations are one common
type of savings club, a popular approach to semiformal saving. These associations
generally operate by pooling weekly deposits and disbursing the entire amount to a
different member each week. Participants get their money, but only when it is their
turn to receive cash, making this method potentially unsuitable for dealing with an
emergency or unexpected need.
Adults may also save only in some other way “using other methods,” as 8 percent
of adults in low- and middle-income economies did (about 16 percent of savers).
The “other methods” could be saving cash at home or saving in the form of assets

Saved formally includes all adults who saved any money in an account. Saved semiformally includes all adults
who saved any money semiformally but none formally. Because an abridged questionnaire was administered
in the Russian Federation in 2024, averages for Europe and Central Asia exclude data for this economy. For

such as livestock, gold or jewelry, or real estate, as well as by using market-traded
or government-backed securities. Women and poor adults were as likely as men
and wealthier adults to save in this way. In 15 low- and middle-income economies,
more than half of people who saved used one or more of these alternate vehicles.
In Moldova, 33 percent of adults (or 82 percent of savers) saved “using other
methods,” making it the economy with the highest share of adults, as well as the
highest share of savers, exclusively using alternate savings vehicles. It is the exception,
however; saving in other ways declined in every region between 2021 and 2024.
The share of adults saving formally grew in every region
The share of adults saving formally in low- and middle-income economies increased
across all regions between 2011 and 2024. In low- and middle-income economies
136 The Global Findex Database 2025
it increased by 22 percentage points, from 17 percent in 2011 to 40 percent in 2024
(refer to figure 3.1.2).7 More than half of that increase occurred between 2021 and
2024, likely driven by changes in macroeconomic conditions, which heavily influence
saving behaviors.
This pattern of especially strong growth in formal saving between 2021 and 2024
holds across regions. East Asia and Pacific registered the largest increase, at
20 percentage points, driven by an increase of 22 percentage points in China alone.
With China excluded, the share of adults in the East Asia and Pacific region saving
formally increased by 9 percentage points between 2021 and 2024.

7 The Global Findex reports data as whole percentage points, although it calculates that whole based on rounding
up or down from the tenths place. As such, any discrepancies between the reported size of a gap and the
difference between its end points is due to rounding.
Saving 137
Women, the poor, people who are out of the workforce, and rural
adults are less likely than men, the rich, those in the workforce,
and urban adults to save in an account
Across low- and middle-income economies, traditionally underserved groups
are consistently less likely to save formally than their better-served peers
(refer to figure 3.1.3).
For example, 36 percent of women saved formally, whereas 43 percent of men did.
Women are less likely than men to have an account, as discussed in chapter 2.1, but
account ownership does not explain the difference in formal saving. Even among
account owners, women are 6 percentage points less likely than men to save
formally: 48 percent of women did so, compared with 54 percent of men.
Gender gaps in the rate of formal saving among account owners vary across
regions. East Asia and Pacific has no significant gender gap in formal saving rates
among account owners, largely because the same share of both women and men
saved in China. When China is excluded, however, the region has a 7 percentage

point formal-saving gender gap. In contrast, Latin America and the Caribbean and
the Middle East and North Africa have the largest gender gaps in formal saving
rates among account owners, at 13 percentage points each. In other regions the
gap ranges between 7 and 10 percentage points. These gender gaps may partly
reflect differences in labor force participation rates across regions.
There are also gaps in formal saving rates based on income and workforce
status, which are similarly not related to account ownership. Adults in the poorest
40 percent of households within economies are less likely to have saved formally
than adults in the wealthiest 60 percent: 28 percent compared with 47 percent.
Among account owners, adults in poorer households are still 18 percentage points
less likely than adults in wealthier households to have saved formally: 40 percent
compared with 58 percent.
Adults who are out of the labor force are also less likely to have saved formally
than those who are active in the labor force, whether wage or self-employed. In
low- and middle-income economies excluding China, the shares are 17 percent and
34 percent.8 Among account owners, adults out of the labor force are 17 percentage
points less likely than adults in the labor force to have saved formally: 28 percent
of account-owning adults out of the labor force have done so, compared with
44 percent of account owners in the labor force. Within the group of adults in the
workforce, account owners who are employed by an employer are most likely to
have saved formally, at 47 percent. This suggests that, not surprisingly, even among
account owners, those with a steady income are most likely to save formally.
Finally, across low- and middle-income economies, rural residents are less likely
to save than urban residents. The share of rural residents who saved formally is
31 percent compared with 47 percent of urban residents. Among account owners,
43 percent of rural residents and 58 percent of urban residents saved.
Mobile money accounts are becoming a popular way of saving
formally in Sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere
As ownership of mobile money accounts has expanded in recent years, so has the
use of these accounts to save. In low- and middle-income economies, 9 percent of
adults saved formally using a mobile money account in 2024 (refer to figure 3.1.4).
This includes 4 percent of adults who saved using only a mobile money account and
5 percent who saved using both a mobile money account and an account at a bank
or similar financial institution. (Thirty percent of adults saved formally using only an
account at a bank or similar financial institution.) The share of adults saving formally

using a mobile money account is up from the 4 percent of adults who did so in 2021,
when the Global Findex survey first asked about saving in these accounts.9
Saving using a mobile money account can be more convenient than saving using
an account at a bank or similar financial institution. Because mobile money service
providers typically have larger retail networks than do banks and similar financial
institutions,10 savers who have mobile money accounts can often make cash
deposits locally, more frequently, and in smaller denominations without incurring
significant time and transaction costs.11
9 Because of COVID-19 restrictions, data collection in 11 Sub-Saharan African economies took place in 2022, after the
publication of the Global Findex 2021 report. As a result, some global and regional averages and some for low- and
middle-income economies shifted slightly from those that were included in the report. The Global Findex team uses
the revised averages in its comparisons. Thus in the case of saving using a mobile money account, the global share
of 5 percent reported in Global Findex 2021 has been revised downward to the 4 percent shown in the chapter here.

The share of adults who saved formally using a mobile money account is much
larger in some regions and economies. Sub-Saharan Africa still has the largest
share of adults who did so: 23 percent of adults in 2024, twice the share in 2021
(refer to figure 3.1.5). In Latin America and the Caribbean, 19 percent of adults
saved formally using a mobile money account, four times the share of adults in
these economies who saved this way in 2021. More than 20 percent of adults
saved using a mobile money account in Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand
as well.
At 15 percent, Sub-Saharan Africa also has the highest share of adults who saved
using only a mobile money account. In all other regions, that share is less than
6 percent.

In the 10 economies with the largest share of adults who saved using a mobile
money account, about a third of adults saved this way. The group includes eight
economies in Sub-Saharan Africa and two in Latin America and the Caribbean. In
five of these economies—Ghana, Kenya, Senegal, Uganda, and Zambia—half of
adults or more used mobile money accounts to save (refer to figure 3.1.6). In Sub-
Saharan Africa, the increase in the percentage of adults who saved using a mobile
money account between 2021 and 2024 boosted the percentage of adults saving
any money at all. In contrast, in Argentina and Brazil, although the percentage of
adults saving in a mobile money account increased, most adults also saved at a
bank or similar financial institution, and the percentage of adults saving only in
some other way went down, suggesting that saving formally is replacing saving
using only other methods.

Saving 143
The share of adults saving formally and receiving interest or
additional money for their savings varies across regions
Global Findex 2025 asked adults who saved formally whether they received interest
or additional money for the savings in their accounts in the past 12 months. In low-
and middle-income economies, 23 percent of adults saved formally and received
interest on or additional money for their savings—or just over half of formal savers.
However, China drove much of that average: its share of adults saving formally and
receiving interest or additional money was more than 50 percent. In East Asia and
Pacific excluding China and in all other regions, 15 percent or less of adults saved
formally and received interest or additional money for their savings. By region, this
represents about a quarter of savers in Sub-Saharan Africa; about a third of savers
in Europe and Central Asia, Middle East and North Africa, and South Asia; and about
4 in 10 savers in East Asia and Pacific, excluding China, and in Latin America and the
Caribbean (refer to figure 3.1.7). Women formal savers are consistently as likely as
men to receive interest, except in Latin America and the Caribbean.

Most adults who saved formally did so monthly
Global Findex 2025 also asked adults who saved formally how often in a typical
month they saved or set aside money in an account: weekly, monthly, or less than
monthly.12 On average, nearly half of adults who saved formally (47 percent) in low-
and middle-income economies did so monthly. Another 37 percent saved less than
monthly, and just 13 percent saved weekly.
This pattern holds broadly across regions. In Sub-Saharan Africa, a relatively larger
share (19 percent) of adults saving formally did so every week. This seems to be
driven in part by the prevalence of mobile money accounts in the region. About a
quarter of adults in the region who saved formally using a mobile money account
did so weekly. That is about double the share of those who saved weekly using
only an account at a bank or similar financial institution. Within subregions in
Sub-Saharan Africa, adults who saved formally using a mobile money account often
made more frequent savings deposits than adults who saved only in a bank or
similar financial institution account (refer to figure 3.1.8).

Saving for old age
Global Findex 2025 asked adults who saved formally whether they specifically
saved for their old age.13 Nearly half of formal savers had done so, resulting in
18 percent of all adults in low- and middle-income economies having both saved
formally and saved for their old age. However, the large share of adults who saved
formally and for their old age in China drove much of that number. With China
excluded, 14 percent of adults in East Asia and Pacific saved formally and for their
old age. No more than 10 percent of adults did so in all other regions. Chapter 4.1,
“Managing financial worrying,” explores saving for old age in more detail.
Opportunities for increasing account use by moving
semiformal savings to accounts
The share of adults saving formally has increased in low- and middle-income
economies in recent years, but opportunities remain to further increase the
use of accounts to save. Moving semiformal or other savings into accounts is
one important opportunity. People who save semiformally may be drawn to the
social aspects of savings clubs. They also may use semiformal saving methods
because they lack affordable and convenient alternatives. Although self-help
group interventions tend to show positive impacts, there is limited evidence
assessing whether alternative delivery mechanisms could be more effective.14
In addition, saving only semiformally can be unsafe15 and limits people’s ability
to build a relationship and a transaction history with a financial institution that
lenders can use to underwrite credit,16 in turn limiting the saver’s access to other
financial services. Saving in an account might be more attractive if banks or similar
financial institutions or mobile money services providers offered free or low-cost
interest-bearing saving products requiring little or no minimum balance.
Encouraging formal savings for those who have saved only semiformally but also
have an account is an especially low-barrier opportunity. Among the 6 percent of
adults who saved only semiformally in low- and middle-income economies, more
than 60 percent—or 190 million adults—already have accounts. In Sub-Saharan
Africa, where 15 percent of adults saved only semiformally, more than 40 percent—
or 47 million adults, including 28 million women—already have an account.
13 In 2021 the Global Findex survey asked all adults, not just those who had saved formally, whether they had saved
money for their old age.

Amassing the resources to enable investments
Saving is broadly viewed as bringing unmitigated financial health benefits for
individuals and households. Borrowing is another approach people take to access
a large enough lump sum of money to address needs or make investments.
The following chapter presents the data on borrowing behavior.

3.2 Borrowing
People borrow money when they need cash that they don’t have, often for a large
expense or investment. The Global Findex 2024 survey asked whether people
borrowed any money in the past year and, if so, the source of the funds (refer to
box 3.2.1). It therefore captured data on demand for credit and access to and use of
it. It did not, however, capture information on the type of loan product, borrowing
amounts, or terms, including duration, interest, collateral, and other lending
conditions. As such, the data cannot provide insights on whether borrowed amounts
were substantial enough to cover expenses or productive investments or whether
respondents may have taken on too much credit.
Yet understanding how many people borrowed money in the year leading up to
the survey is essential for assessing both individual and national financial health,
identifying trends in credit use and debt burdens, and guiding policies that promote
economic stability, financial literacy, and overall well-being.
In low- and middle-income economies in 2024, 59 percent of adults borrowed money
in the 12 months before taking the survey. This percentage includes all adults who
used formal or informal credit. The remainder of the chapter explores the different
forms of borrowing and then examines trends in the sources of formal borrowing.
Box 3.2.1 What it means to borrow formally and where the Global
Findex survey asked about it
Global Findex 2025 defines formal borrowing as borrowing from a bank or similar
financial institution such as a credit union, a microfinance institution, or a post office;
through a credit card; or through a mobile money provider included in the GSMA’s
Mobile Money Deployment Tracker.a Each economy identifies the banks and financial
institutions that offer credit within that economy and are subject to prudential
regulation by a government authority there; the list of institutions may vary from the
list included in chapter 2.1, as some economies regulate non-deposit-taking lenders.
The Global Findex 2024 survey collected data separately for formal borrowing
• From a bank or similar financial institution
• Using a credit card
• Through a mobile money account (refer to box 2.1.1 for the full definition of
accounts used by Global Findex 2025).b

Box 3.2.1 What it means to borrow formally and where the Global
Findex survey asked about it (continued)
For most high-income economies and the Russian Federation, the survey included only
questions on account ownership, not questions on borrowing. As a result, this section
does not report global or high-income averages. The “Methodology” tab of the Global
Findex website (http://globalfindex.worldbank.org) provides details on the information
collected in each surveyed economy.
a. The tracker is available at https://www.gsma.com/mobile-money-metrics/#deployment-tracker.
b. The Global Findex 2025 asked about borrowing from a mobile money provider only of adults who
have used a mobile money services provider included in the GSMA’s Mobile Money Deployment
Tracker and who live in economies in which mobile money accounts exist.
An equal share of borrowers relied on formal sources and on
family or friends
On average, 24 percent of adults—40 percent of borrowers—borrowed formally in
2024. They got credit through a loan from a bank or similar financial institution or
through the use of a credit card or a mobile money account. Formal borrowing’s
share of total borrowing varied across low- and-middle income economies
(refer to map 3.2.1).

Another 5 percent of adults borrowed semiformally, from a savings club, such as a
rotation savings and credit association, including 3 percent of adults who borrowed
only semiformally, but not formally.1 Overall, 31 percent of adults borrowed from
family or friends, with 21 percent of adults borrowing only this way and not also
formally or semiformally. Other credit sources were tapped by 12 percent of adults
(refer to figure 3.2.1); these sources could include buy-now-pay-later options, which
have become more popular around the world in recent years.2 They could also
include credit extended for buying groceries, which chapter 4.1 explores in the
context of financial health.

from previously published numbers.
The share of adults borrowing
formally grew in low- and middle-income economies
The average share of adults borrowing formally in low- and middle-income
economies increased over time, from 15 percent of adults in 2014 to 24 percent of
adults in 2024 (refer to figure 3.2.2).3
3 Past editions of Global Findex reported 16 percent as the share of adults who borrowed in low- and middle-
income economies in 2014. Some economies have graduated to high-income status since the first round of data
collection, however. Global Findex 2025 uses the World Bank’s fiscal year 2024 income classification for all rounds
of data to ensure consistency of group composition for aggregate averages.
154 The Global Findex Database 2025
However, the share of adults borrowing formally varied more widely across regions
than over time, from 34 percent in East Asia and Pacific to 12 percent in the Middle
East and North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa.
In East Asia and Pacific, Europe and Central Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean,
formal sources were the most common, used by half or more of borrowers. Meanwhile,
in the Middle East and North Africa, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa, only about
20 percent of borrowers accessed formal credit. As mentioned, borrowing only from
family or friends was the most common source for borrowing in these regions.
Women were less likely than men to have borrowed formally
Gender patterns around formal borrowing show the opposite trends from
those around borrowing informally. Across low- and middle-income countries,
22 percent of women borrowed formally, compared with 26 percent of men (refer
to figure 3.2.3). This gender gap persisted among account owners: 29 percent of
women with an account borrowed formally, compared with 33 percent of men.

Borrowing 155
Across regions, gender gaps in formal borrowing among account owners ranged
from statistically nonsignificant in East Asia and Pacific and the Middle East and
North Africa to 8 percentage points in Latin America and the Caribbean. The gender
gap was 11 percentage points in Europe and Central Asia, largely because of a
gender gap of 21 percentage points in Türkiye. South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa
had gender gaps of 6 and 5 percentage points, respectively. When formal borrowing
among adults who borrow is considered, the gender gap remains the same at
4 percentage points.
The data show similar differences for other groups. Adults from the poorest 40 percent
of households by income were 10 percentage points less likely to borrow formally
than adults from the wealthiest 60 percent, a difference that drops to 8 percentage
points when only account owners in each group are considered. One in three wage-
employed adults with an account borrowed formally, compared with one in four
self-employed account owners and just over one in seven adults who were out of the
workforce. Rural residents were 10 percentage points less likely than urban residents
to borrow formally, both as a share of adults and as a share of account owners.
The share of adults borrowing formally by using credit cards was generally
small, though this type of borrowing dominated in a few low- and
middle-income economies
Credit cards are both a payment instrument and a credit source. They provide
short-term credit whenever they are used, even when credit card holders pay their
balances in full each statement cycle and thus pay no interest on those balances.
Credit cards’ entry into an economy may therefore affect the demand for and use of
other forms of credit.
In low- and middle-income economies in 2024, just 15 percent of adults used a credit
card in the past 12 months. As in 2021, the exceptions were Argentina, Brazil, China,
Türkiye, and Ukraine, where at least 25 percent of adults did. Credit cards dominated
as a source of formal credit in these economies: the share of formal borrowers who
used credit cards but did not also borrow from a financial institution or a mobile
money account was about 70 percent in Türkiye, about 60 percent in Argentina and
Brazil, and about 50 percent in China and Ukraine (refer to figure 3.2.4).4
To provide a better understanding of how adults use credit cards, the Global Findex
2024 survey asked whether adults who used a credit card paid off their balances
4 This compares with 51 percent of adults who used a credit card in the past 12 months in high-income economies
according to the Global Findex 2021 survey. Among formal borrowers in high-income economies in 2021, two-
thirds borrowed using a credit card, but not from a bank or similar financial institution or through the use of a
mobile money account.

Mobile money accounts are the dominant source of formal credit in some
economies in Sub-Saharan Africa
As mobile phone ownership and availability of mobile financial services have
increased—discussed in chapters 1.1 and 2.1, respectively—so has the range
of mobile money account features in some economies that allow those with an
account to borrow. If someone is borrowing through a mobile money account,
the borrowing could involve money that comes directly from the mobile money
provider or from a partnership between the provider and a bank or similar financial
institution; it could also take the form of minutes or data. Loans of these types are
generally small in value and of short duration (repayment is typically due within a
month and often within one to two weeks) and carry high effective interest rates.5
Evidence suggests such loans can modestly increase consumption, financial health,
and subjective well-being without reducing savings or assets, though their effects
are not transformative.6 In 2024, only 4 percent of adults in low- and middle-income
economies borrowed through their mobile money accounts.
In Sub-Saharan Africa, where mobile money account ownership is most widespread,
just 7 percent of adults borrowed from their mobile money providers. This share
is unchanged from the share in 2021, when the Global Findex survey first asked
about borrowing from a mobile money provider. Because overall levels of formal
borrowing in Sub-Saharan Africa are low, borrowing from a mobile money provider
constituted nearly 60 percent of all formal borrowing in the region in 2024.
Economies with some of the highest rates of mobile money account ownership
in Sub-Saharan Africa also have the highest rates of people borrowing from their
mobile money providers. In Kenya, the region’s pioneer in mobile money, 32 percent
of adults—or 86 percent of formal borrowers—borrowed from their mobile money
providers, including 25 percent of adults who borrowed only in this way (refer
to figure 3.2.6). In both Ghana and Uganda, 22 percent of adults—or 74 percent
and 76 percent of formal borrowers, respectively—borrowed from mobile money
providers, with virtually all of them borrowing only from mobile money providers.
In Ghana, the rise in borrowing through a mobile money account between 2021 and
2024 drove an overall increase in formal borrowing over that period. In Kenya and
Uganda, the share of formal borrowing remained about the same in 2024 as that
in 2021, but a larger share of formal borrowers got a loan through a mobile money
account in 2024. In all three of these economies, the share of adults borrowing only
from a bank or similar financial institution decreased as a larger share of adults took

advantage of mobile money borrowing; whether that change was driven by supply
(that is, banks pulling back on lending or collaborating with mobile money providers
in new business models) or demand (that is, borrowers turning away from banks as
an option) is not evident from the Global Findex survey data.
Despite similar levels of overall borrowing by gender in all three economies,
borrowing from a mobile money provider differs according to gender in these
economies. In Ghana, women are 4 percentage points less likely than men to

borrow from this source, whereas in Kenya and Uganda, the gaps are 16 and
13 percentage points, respectively. Similar gaps exist between adults from the
poorest 40 percent and wealthiest 60 percent of households by income.
An emerging source of formal borrowing in Sub-Saharan Africa is other
digital credit
The Global Findex 2025, in addition to asking questions about borrowing through a
mobile money provider, for the first time asked about other sources of digital credit,
to capture data on people who do not borrow through a mobile money account, but
rather through some other digital method. In particular, the survey asked separately
about applying for and receiving a loan through a mobile phone: 1 percent of adults
in low- and middle-income economies borrowed only this way (and not through a
mobile money account, from a bank or similar financial institution, or through a
credit card), including 3 percent of adults in Sub-Saharan Africa. This region is home
to all seven of the world’s economies in which at least 5 percent of adults report they
borrowed through a mobile phone but did not borrow formally otherwise.7 Although
this source of digital credit is one to watch, given the overall small share of adults
who used it but did not borrow formally and the uncertainty about who provides
the digital credit, Global Findex 2025 does not include it in its definition of formal
borrowing.
Some adults borrowed to pay health or medical bills and some
to start or operate a business
The evidence is mixed on the effects of microcredit access among poor adults,
especially long-term effects on consumption, health, and women’s economic
empowerment.8 Yet some of the literature has found that expanding access to
high-interest consumer credit through microfinance loans can improve borrower
welfare—boosting consumption, self-sufficiency, and some mental health
outcomes—without causing harmful overborrowing, challenging assumptions
that such lending is necessarily exploitative.9 Other studies, however, do not find
broader economywide effects but infer that microfinance loans are likely to help
households smooth consumption,10 in the wake of a financial shock as well as at
other times.11
7 The seven economies are Cameroon (5 percent), the Republic of Congo (5 percent), Eswatini (12 percent),
Gabon (7 percent), Lesotho (8 percent), Mauritania (8 percent), and Senegal (9 percent).

160 The Global Findex Database 2025
The Global Findex 2025 also asked adults whether they borrowed money to start
or operate a business in the past year. In low- and middle-income economies,
11 percent of adults borrowed money for this reason, with just over half of that group
(6 percent of adults) also saying they only borrowed informally (the survey did not
ask directly whether adults who borrowed to start or operate a business did so from
formal or informal sources).
The Global Findex 2025 additionally asked adults whether they borrowed money
to pay health or medical expenses in the past year. In low- and middle-income
economies, 19 percent of adults borrowed money for this reason. The proportion
was about the same in 2021, but an increase from those in 2014 and 2017, when
about 11 percent of adults borrowed to pay health or medical expenses.
Chapter 4.1 explores borrowing for starting or operating a business and
borrowing for health or medical expenses in more detail in the context of
financial health.
In the context of other financial services, formal borrowing is
less common than saving or payments
The data shared in this chapter highlight that borrowing increased between 2021
and 2024. Yet formal borrowing remained much less common in 2024 than saving.
It was also less common than using accounts to make or receive payments, the
subject of the next chapter.

wherever they are—can have a significant and positive impact on people’s finances.
Research finds that digital payments are associated with lower risk of theft,1
greater speed and reliability,2 and decreased personal costs because they eliminate
expenses associated with traveling to make payments in person or collect money.3
Making or receiving payments using an account also creates a record of digital
transactions that can support credit applications.4 Finally, research finds that having
an account to receive payments increases the frequency and volume of remittances
and financial support from family members and friends.5
The Global Findex 2025 asked respondents whether they made or received a range
of payments in the 12 months before taking the survey and how they did it, in order
to understand more about their payment behaviors.
But first, a caveat: although the Global Findex captures trends around end-
user behavior, that behavior depends on the context in which it takes place.
A supportive enabling environment is essential if digital payments are to replace
cash for everyday transactions. Fast and reliable digital infrastructure, widespread
connectivity, and interoperable payment systems that make digital transactions
seamless and inexpensive all make up the foundations of such an environment.
Strong regulation is also critical, including well-designed and well-enforced
consumer protection measures that build trust in digital systems. Digital public
infrastructure, which includes digital ID and verification systems, data exchange
systems, and fast payment systems, also enables secure, real-time, and inclusive
financial transactions.6 When well designed, these systems can lower costs, increase
access for underserved communities, and accelerate the shift to digital payments,
particularly in low- and middle-income economies.7

More than 80 percent of account owners made or received
digital payments
Across low- and middle-income economies, 62 percent of all adults—or 82 percent
of account owners—either made or received at least one digital payment in the
12 months before taking the survey (refer to map 3.3.1 and figure 3.3.1; refer to
box 3.3.1 for how the Global Findex defines making and receiving digital payments).8
Whereas the share of adults who made or received a digital payment increased by
6 percentage points in 2024 compared with the share in 2021, the share of account
owners using digital payments remained steady at about 80 percent. However,
the share of adults using digital payments in low- and middle-income economies
almost doubled, from 34 percent of adults in 2014, when the Global Findex first
collected data on digital payments, to 62 percent in 2024. In terms of the share
of account owners using digital payments, in 2024, 82 percent of account owners
did so, up from 63 percent in 2014 and about the same percentage as in 2021, when
the COVID-19 pandemic prompted many adults to make their first digital payments.

Box 3.3.1 What it means to make or receive a digital payment and
where the Global Findex survey asked about it
The Global Findex 2025 defines a digital payment as any payment sent directly from
or received directly in an account at a bank or similar financial institution, like a credit
union, microfinance institution, or post office, or using a mobile money account
(Box continued next page)
Payments 167
Box 3.3.1 What it means to make or receive a digital payment and
where the Global Findex survey asked about it (continued)
included in the GSMA Mobile Money Deployment Tracker (refer to box 2.1.1 for the full
Global Findex 2025 definition of an account).
Account owners can make digital payments directly from their accounts using
debit or credit cards, mobile phones, or the internet or by transferring funds
directly to another account. The survey measures activity around several types of
payments people make, including merchant and utility bill payments, as well as
making bill payments or domestic person-to-person payments.
The survey also captures whether people received certain types of payments
(for example, government payments, including social disbursement and pension
payments; wage payments from the government or the private sector; and
agriculture payments) and whether they received them directly in an account, in cash,
or through another method. Receiving payments also includes receiving domestic
person-to-person payments.
For most high-income economies and the Russian Federation, the Global Findex
survey includes only questions on account ownership and not questions on
payments. As a result, there are no global or high-income averages in this chapter,
and Russia is excluded from all averages for Europe and Central Asia.
In Algeria, China, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Libya, Mauritius, and Ukraine, an
abridged questionnaire was administered by phone, and it did not include any of the
questions on receiving payments. Regarding making payments, the questionnaire
in these economies included questions on merchant payments and bill payments,
but not on making utility bill payments and making domestic person-to-person
payments.
For these six economies, adults who make a digital payment or access their accounts
using a credit or debit card or phone are identified as having made or received a
digital payment. However, because data for these six economies do not include
information on receiving payments, the time series figures for receiving payments
have been adjusted to exclude data from these economies in previous years to enable
consistent year-over-year comparisons.
The “Methodology” tab of the Global Findex website (http://globalfindex.worldbank
.org) provides details on the information collected in each surveyed economy.

Digital payment gaps persist among account owners
In low- and middle-income economies, women and poorer adults are less likely than
men and wealthier adults to have an account, as documented in chapter 2.1. Use of
digital payments is also relatively lower among these groups.
Women are less likely to use digital payments
In addition to the gap among all adults, among account owners, women are also
less likely than men to use digital payments. The gender gap is not universal,
however. In fact, the gender gap in the use of digital payments among account
owners is statistically nonsignificant in most regions. In Europe and Central Asia,
however, 84 percent of women with an account use digital payments compared with
93 percent of men. This difference is driven by a 13 percentage point gender gap
in Türkiye.
In South Asia, the region with the lowest share of digital payment use among
account owners, women are 15 percentage points less likely than men to use digital
payments, with just half of women account owners doing so, compared with nearly
two-thirds of men account owners (refer to figure 3.3.3). Some economies in the

region have even larger gender gaps. Nepal, for example, has a gap of more than
20 percentage points (36 percent of women with accounts versus 58 percent of
men), as does Pakistan (74 percent of women with accounts versus 95 percent of
men), and the gaps are about 13 percentage points each, also in favor of men, in
Bangladesh, India, and Sri Lanka.
Poorer, rural, and young account owners are also less likely to
use digital payments
The income gap in the use of digital payments is even wider than the gender
gap. Among adults with an account, the income gap is 10 percentage points, with
76 percent of adults in the poorest 40 percent of households within economies
using digital payments, compared with 86 percent of adults in the wealthiest
60 percent (refer to figure 3.3.4). This gap has remained unchanged compared with
that in 2021 despite a 5 percentage point growth in the use of digital payments
among poorer adults.
In most regions, the income gap in digital payment use is about 6 percentage
points, but in South Asia it is 20 percentage points. Specifically, 45 percent of poorer
adults with accounts use digital payments, compared with 64 percent of wealthier
adults in the region. This divide is driven by India, where 42 percent of poorer

adults with accounts and 62 percent of wealthier adults with accounts use digital
payments. In other economies in South Asia, the gap among account owners is
10 percentage points or less. In Pakistan, for example, both account ownership
and digital payment use are low, yet 90 percent or more of account owners in
both poorer and wealthier households use digital payments. This disparity might
be driven by the use of accounts for social transfer payments (discussed later in
this chapter).
Across low- and middle-income economies, adults living in rural areas are
16 percentage points less likely than adults in urban areas to make a digital
payment: 53 percent compared with 69 percent. The gap narrows when measured
as a share of account owners: 75 percent of rural account owners use digital
payments, compared with 87 percent of urban account owners.
Young adults are more than 10 percentage points less likely than older adults to
use digital payments, though among those with accounts, the difference is just
4 percentage points.
Payments 171
The patterns described thus far detailing digital payment use by region and among
women and men, poorer and wealthier adults, and rural and urban residents
repeat with only slight variations across the different payment types explored in the
remainder of this chapter.
Making digital payments
The Global Findex 2025 asks about several common payments people make or send,
including merchant payments, payments of utility and other bills, and person-to-
person (P2P) payments.9 The share of adults making any of these types of payments
digitally in the economies that answered the full set of questions about payments
is 52 percent, or two-thirds (69 percent) of account owners. Compared with that in
2021, the share of account owners making digital payments remained unchanged.
Digital merchant payments show continued growth since COVID-19
Merchant payments are nearly universal: almost everyone pays businesses for
something.10 Whether for food, household supplies, personal items, and clothing
or for electronic devices, appliances, and furniture, merchant payments can be
of low value and frequent or of high value and occasional. Encouraging payers
to make such payments from an account using a debit or credit card or mobile
phone (that is, digitally) instead of in cash can benefit payers by making the money
transferred safer from theft. Paying digitally also creates a record of payment, which
is helpful in cases of disputes and for enabling household financial management.
Businesses also benefit from such a digital payment record, because they can use it
to document profitability and cash flows, both critical enablers of embedded finance
models that can help small businesses grow and create jobs.11
The caveat for businesses, however, is that they face multiple constraints to
adoption of digital payments, including low payment digitalization in the broader
ecosystems in which they operate and potentially high costs of accepting digital
payments, including the costs of payment infrastructure (point-of-service devices
or smartphones with payment apps) and payment fees. Business informality and
distrust of providers of payment services and governments could also dissuade
businesses from adopting digital payments.
9 The Global Findex 2025 also asked respondents about receiving P2P payments. Making and receiving P2P
payments are discussed in the section “Receiving Payments.”
10 The survey asked merchants in all low- and middle-income economies except Russia questions about digital payments.

/digital-credit-models-for-small-businesses).
172 The Global Findex Database 2025
For these reasons and others, ecosystems for merchant payments in many low-
and middle-income economies continue to be cash driven. That is slowly changing,
however. As of 2024, 42 percent of adults made a digital merchant payment
either in a store or online (refer to figure 3.3.5).12 This represents a 7 percentage
point increase from 2021, when the Global Findex survey first asked about digital
merchant payments. About 40 percent of adults making digital merchant payments
in that year started using them for the first time after the beginning of the COVID-19
pandemic.
Most economies have maintained the levels of adoption of digital merchant
payments they showed in 2021 and have continued the general trend toward
growth. Nonetheless, some economies have much higher levels of adoption of
digital merchant payments than average. In China, for example, 80 percent of adults
made a digital merchant payment in 2024. When data for China are excluded, the
low- and middle-income average for use of digital merchant payments is 24 percent
of adults.

12 The Global Findex 2025 includes adults that report paying for an online purchase both in cash and online as
making an online digital payment.
Payments 173
Use of digital merchant payments is greatest in East Asia and Pacific, at 67 percent
of all adults. This high percentage is driven by that in China, where, as mentioned,
80 percent of adults made a digital merchant payment. This is consistent with
the Chinese economy’s high levels of smartphone penetration, internet use, and
adoption of digital activities, as discussed in chapters 1.1 and 1.2.
When data for China are excluded, 27 percent of adults in East Asia and Pacific
made a digital merchant payment, though several economies experienced notable
increases between 2021 and 2024. Examples include Cambodia, the Lao People’s
Democratic Republic, and Viet Nam, where the share of adults making digital
merchant payments at least doubled during that period, from 3 percent, 9 percent,
and 24 percent of adults, respectively, to 20 percent, 22 percent, and 51 percent,
respectively. Among low- and middle-income economies, Mongolia has the highest
rate of digital merchant payments at 95 percent (about equivalent to its share of
account ownership).
The regions with the next-highest shares of adults making digital merchant
payments are Europe and Central Asia at 51 percent (a 9 percentage points increase
from 2021) and Latin America and the Caribbean at 43 percent (a slight increase,
5 percentage points). The Middle East and North Africa saw its rate of use of digital
merchant payments almost triple since 2021, albeit from a low base, to 26 percent
of adults. This increase was driven entirely by a 64 percentage point increase in
digital merchant payments in the Islamic Republic of Iran. When data for the Islamic
Republic of Iran are excluded, the average for the Middle East and North Africa is
7 percent.
In South Asia, 15 percent of adults made digital merchant payments in 2024, and
in Sub-Saharan Africa, 20 percent of adults did, increases of 5 and 7 percentage
points, respectively, compared with the shares in 2021. In a few individual
economies in Sub-Saharan Africa, the share of adults making digital merchant
payments grew twofold or more between 2021 and 2024. They include Cameroon
and Zambia, in both of which the share of adults making digital merchant
payments is now at about 20 percent; Ghana and Nigeria, where the share reached
about 28 percent at the end of that period; and Senegal, where it is 37 percent.
In Kenya, adoption of digital merchant payments increased from 37 percent to
56 percent of adults.
Outside of Sub-Saharan Africa, in economies like Armenia, the Dominican Republic,
the Kyrgyz Republic, Paraguay, and Tajikistan, adoption of digital merchant
payments doubled between 2021 and 2024, albeit from lower shares, reaching
26 percent or more of adults in all five economies.
174 The Global Findex Database 2025
Women, poorer adults, and rural adults are less likely than men, wealthier adults,
and urban adults to make digital merchant payments
Women and men make digital merchant payments at different rates, though the
6 percentage point gap between the two is consistent with the gender gap in
account ownership. Among all adults, 38 percent of women made digital merchant
payments in low- and middle-income economies and 45 percent of men did. South
Asia had the widest gender gap in digital merchant payments at 13 percentage
points; East Asia and Pacific, in contrast, had no gap.
Not surprisingly, adoption levels and growth rates of digital merchant payments
are lower among adults living in the poorest 40 percent of households within
economies compared with the levels and rates in the wealthiest 60 percent of
households. Overall, 31 percent of poorer adults made a digital merchant payment,
compared with 48 percent of wealthier adults. Both of those shares reflect increases
from 2021, when 27 percent of poorer adults made a digital merchant payment and
40 percent of wealthier adults did; the difference for the poorer income group is
under the threshold for statistical significance, however.
Variation by rural versus urban context is even greater. Among adults living in rural
areas, 28 percent made digital merchant payments, compared with 53 percent of
adults living in urban areas. Importantly, this difference is not exclusively driven
by differences in account ownership among these groups. When adoption rates
for digital merchant payments among account owners are examined, adults living
in rural areas are still 27 percentage points less likely to make a digital merchant
payment than those living in urban areas. This may be because fewer rural
merchants accept digital payments.
Online shopping and digital merchant payments
The subset of digital merchant payments that is specific to online purchases shows
distinct patterns among regions of the world. These patterns are mostly consistent
with the global trends in smartphone ownership and internet use discussed in
chapters 1.1 and 1.2. The regions and economies with higher levels of digital
connectivity have higher rates of online shopping behaviors, though rates of digital
payment show patterns that are more nuanced.
Overall, in low- and middle-income economies, 36 percent of adults bought
something online. Of these online shoppers, nearly 20 percent paid for their online
purchases exclusively using cash on delivery.13
13 In low- and middle-income economies, 5 percent of online shoppers paid both online and on delivery.
Payments 175
East Asia and Pacific had the highest share of online shoppers at 65 percent of
all adults, with 87 percent of shoppers also paying for their purchases online
(refer to figure 3.3.6). Yet as with the overall trends in digital merchant payments
in the region, rates of adoption of online payment are driven mostly by high
usage levels in China. When data for China are excluded, online shopping rates
for East Asia and Pacific drop to 34 percent of adults, with just over half of them,
18 percent, paying cash on delivery. Rates of this behavior are particularly high
in certain of the region’s economies. For instance, in Malaysia and Thailand,
between 30 percent and 40 percent of adults making online purchases
pay cash on delivery; in Indonesia and the Philippines, more than half do
(refer to figure 3.3.7).
Latin America and the Caribbean had the highest share of online shoppers
who paid digitally: 27 percent of adults shopped online, and 87 percent of
them paid online. South Asia had the lowest relative share of online purchasers
paying online: 14 percent of adults shopped online, and about half of them paid
digitally.

In Sub-Saharan Africa, adults also make digital merchant payments
in informal markets
In many parts of the world, people do some or all of their shopping for groceries
and household supplies in outdoor markets. To capture digital merchant payments
that are not technically in stores or online, the Global Findex 2025 asked people
for the first time if they used their debit or credit cards or mobile phones to pay for
household food or cleaning supplies. In the low- and middle-income economies in
which this question was asked,14 18 percent of all adults did so.
Although this specific use case for digital merchant payments is not included in the
Global Findex definition for made a digital payment or received a digital payment,
doing so would add 0.5 percent of adults in low- and middle-income economies,
including 1 percent of adults in Sub-Saharan Africa. Inclusion of adults who use

phones or debit or credit cards to pay for groceries, but do not make in-store digital
payments, adds 3 percentage points to the low- and middle-income economy
averages for digital merchant payments and 4 percentage points to the average
for Sub-Saharan Africa. This margin of increase is highest in Kenya (15 percentage
points) and in Botswana and Zambia (8 and 9 percentage points, respectively).
This suggests possible opportunities for merchants without established physical
storefronts to leverage records of their digital payment inflows as proof of income
when applying for credit.15
Online bill payments
Separate from online shopping, since 2017 the Global Findex has asked, across all
low- and middle-income economies, whether respondents paid a bill using a mobile
phone or computer. In 2024, 37 percent of adults, or 49 percent of account owners,
paid a bill online, up from 28 percent of all adults (41 percent of account owners) in
2021 and 16 percent of all adults (about 25 percent of account owners) in 2017 (refer
to figure 3.3.8).

A few economies have very high rates of online bill payment. In China, 74 percent
of adults made an online bill payment, and in Brazil, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Mongolia,
Türkiye, and Ukraine, just over half (between 51 percent and 55 percent) of adults
did. The regional averages are more modest. For example, in East Asia and Pacific
excluding China, 39 percent of adults made an online bill payment. In Europe and
Central Asia, 42 percent did, and in Latin America and the Caribbean, 35 percent did.
Only about 15 percent of adults paid bills online in the Middle East and North Africa,
South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa. Across all regions, the share of adults making
online bill payments increased between 2021 and 2024.
More adults in low- and middle-income economies are paying their utility
bills digitally
Utility bills, as distinct from the more general online bills discussed previously, are
interesting from the perspective of adoption of digital payments because they come
due at a regular cadence and therefore help promote habitual behavior. They are
also associated with access to essential infrastructure like water and electricity.
Paying them digitally can increase on-time payment and enable innovations such
as pay-as-you-go delivery models,16 rebates for energy savings, and green energy
credits, all of which can inform sustainable infrastructure development.17
In low- and middle-income economies,18 45 percent of all adults made regular
payments for water, electricity, or trash collection, with about 40 percent of these
respondents (17 percent of all adults) making those payments digitally.19 The rest
paid only in cash, and a small but declining share paid “some other way.” Between
2014 and 2024, the share of adults paying digitally increased from 32 percent to
39 percent of utility bill payers.
Across economies and regions, utility bill payment practices vary. In Europe and
Central Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, and Sub-Saharan Africa, just over
half of adults who paid utility bills did so digitally (refer to figure 3.3.9). By contrast,
about a third of utility bill payers did so in East Asia and Pacific and South Asia. In
the Middle East and North Africa less than 10 percent did so. Notably, in Kenya
and Mongolia, close to 100 percent of adults who made utility bill payments did so
digitally.

did.

Most people pay in cash out of habit
Efforts to encourage people to make more of their payments digitally cannot
assume that people will be compelled to use digital payment options just because
they are available. Digital payments need to be perceived as better than cash
payments, not simply an alternative to them.
To understand the barriers to adoption of digital payment, the Global Findex 2025
asked respondents with accounts who exclusively make merchant payments in
cash why they do not pay digitally. The most common answer is habit: across
all regions, people say they are simply used to paying merchants in cash (refer
to figure 3.3.10). This may imply that the benefits of making digital merchant
payments are not valuable enough to warrant making the switch away from paying
in cash.20 Furthermore, some merchants accept only cash or charge more for digital
payments, though those barriers stand out for only a minority of cash users.

Digital payments cannot replace cash payments until merchants and other payment
recipients operate in a supportive business environment, with affordable and
reliable access to a digital ecosystem. For example, most small merchants use much
of their revenues to restock inventory. If they are unable to pay their suppliers in
cash because their customers pay digitally, then collecting payments digitally adds
both time and monetary costs, as it requires them to close their shops, find agents,
and pay cash-out fees to access the cash needed to restock. They can avoid all of
this by simply accepting only cash payments from the start, which is why many
merchants offer no options for digital payment.
Promoting acceptance of digital payment methods among merchants requires
delivering clear value propositions, such as, for instance, services built on a digital
infrastructure that directly benefit their businesses and expand access to credit.
New underwriting models that leverage digital payment data and tools can enable
lenders to more accurately assess a merchant borrower’s ability to repay a loan.
Certain tools can also divert payments directly toward loan repayment, helping
lenders better measure and manage risk.
Payments 181
In addition, changing cash-paying habits among buyers requires time and
evidence of benefits, the latter of which could become clear as more members
of poorer communities acquire accounts and people see others using digital
payments.21 Governments such as the Republic of Korea’s have nudged that
progress by implementing tax incentives to encourage digital payments,22 and
financial institutions might offer rewards such as cash back or lower fees for using
digital methods. These initiatives likely will have to be just one aspect of holistic
efforts to transition cash habits to digital ones. Public awareness campaigns
could also play a role, for example, by highlighting the often-overlooked costs
associated with cash usage, including security risks, withdrawal fees, and the
inconvenience of handling physical currency.
Receiving payments
In low- and middle-income economies (not including the six economies in which
questions on receiving payments were not asked),23 36 percent of adults—or more
than half of account owners—had received a digital payment in the last 12 months.
These payments included payments from governments, employers, or sale of
agricultural products as well as P2P payments from family members or someone in
recipients’ social networks.
Government payments continue to become digitalized
In the low- and middle-income economies in which questions relating to receiving
payments were asked, 23 percent of adults received a government-to-person
(G2P) payment in some form, whether a social disbursement, a pension payment,
or payment of a public sector wage. About three-quarters of recipients of G2P
payments (73 percent) received them directly in an account.24 This reflects an
increase in the share of G2P payments disbursed digitally in these economies
from 60 percent in 2017 to 62 percent in 2021. It includes 3 percent of adults who
received government wage payments and 14 percent who received government
transfers or pension payments. The remaining recipients of G2P payments received
them in cash or some other form, such as a voucher.
21 Higgins (2024).
22 Sung, Awasthi, and Lee (2017).
23 Because an abridged questionnaire was administered in Algeria, China, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Libya,
Mauritius, Russia, and Ukraine, questions on receiving payments were not asked in these economies, and data
related to these questions are not included in averages for regions and low- and middle-income economies.
24 This includes less than 1 percent of adults who said they received such payments directly on a payment card
issued for the disbursement of wages or government payments and typically linked to an individual account. The
Global Findex considers this to be a payment into an account. Refer to the definition of account in box 2.1.1.
182 The Global Findex Database 2025
Although the share of adults receiving G2P payments ranges from 13 percent of
adults in Sub-Saharan Africa to about a third of adults in East Asia and Pacific and
Europe and Central Asia, in every region more than half of adults receiving such
payments were paid digitally (refer to figure 3.3.11). The share is even higher in
Latin America and the Caribbean and South Asia, where 77 percent of recipients
did so, and in Europe and Central Asia and the Middle East and North Africa,
where more than 80 percent of recipients did so. This trend toward G2P payment
digitalization is grounded in the myriad benefits it provides both to governments,
in terms of accountability, efficiency, and cost saving, and to recipients, in terms of
safety and time savings.25
South Asia stands out for the growing share of adults in the region receiving digital
G2P payments. In India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, the share of adults receiving G2P
payments digitally grew by about 20 percentage points between 2017 and 2024.
Other economies, such as the Kyrgyz Republic and Morocco, experienced similarly
impressive growth in the share of adults receiving digital G2P payments.

On average, women and men who receive a G2P payment are equally likely to
receive it digitally. But adults living in the poorest 40 percent of households within
economies and receiving G2P payments are 10 percentage points less likely to
receive such payments digitally than adults living in the wealthiest 60 percent of
households within economies and receiving these payments.
Private sector wages are increasingly paid digitally
In low- and middle-income economies, 28 percent of adults received wage
payments from private sector employers. Forty-five percent of those payments were
deposited into accounts, an increase from 28 percent in 2014 and about the same
share as in 2021.
These averages mask large variations across regions and economies
(refer to figure 3.3.12). Europe and Central Asia and Latin America and the
Caribbean have the highest shares of private sector wages received digitally
at 79 percent and 72 percent, respectively. By contrast, in the Middle East and
North Africa, only 20 percent of those receiving a private sector wage payment
do so digitally.

Within regions there can be large variations as well, and an economy’s income
group does not necessarily predict the share of people within that economy who
receive a private sector wage payment in an account. In East Asia and Pacific
and Sub-Saharan Africa, for example, roughly half of the adults receiving private
sector wage payments do so digitally. That share is about 80 percent in Kenya and
Viet Nam, both lower-middle-income economies. Yet in Mongolia, also a lower-
middle-income economy, nearly all (94 percent) recipients of private sector wages
were paid digitally.
Women and men who receive wages are equally likely to receive them digitally
Women are almost half as likely as men to receive wages in low- and middle-
income economies—19 percent versus 36 percent—though the same share of
wage-receiving women as wage-receiving men receive them in accounts (refer to
figure 3.3.13).

As with other payment types, there are regional variations. In East Asia and Pacific
and Europe and Central Asia, women receiving private sector wage payments
are about 6 percentage points more likely than men who receive such payments
to receive them in accounts. In Latin America and the Caribbean and the Middle
East and North Africa, on the other hand, women and men who receive such
payments are equally likely to receive them in accounts. By contrast, in South Asia
women receiving private sector wage payments are 14 percentage points less
likely to receive such payments in accounts, and in Sub-Saharan Africa, the gap is
6 percentage points, with women again less likely than men.
Adults living in the poorest 40 percent of households within economies are
8 percentage points less likely than those in the wealthiest 60 percent to receive
private sector wage payments. They are also consistently less likely to receive
payment of those wages in an account: 32 percent versus 52 percent. These
disparities hold in every world region, with low-income wage earners consistently
less likely to have private sector wages paid into an account than their higher-
income peers.
Agricultural payments were received mostly in cash, with some
notable exceptions
Farmers, like many others, benefit from formal financial services. Keeping their
money in an account can help them save and stretch their income across harvest
seasons, finance their purchases of agricultural inputs like seeds and fertilizer, and
receive payments for the sale of their products.26
Fourteen percent of all adults in low- and middle-income economies received
payments for the sale of agricultural goods, and most of these payments were in
cash. Only about a quarter of recipients of such payments, or 4 percent of all adults,
received them in accounts.
Sub-Saharan African economies, on average, are consistent with this pattern
of about 25 percent of agricultural payment recipients being paid into an
account, even though 30 percent of adults receive these payments, more than
twice the low- and middle-income economy average. In some economies in the
region, however, a much larger share of recipients are paid digitally (refer to
figure 3.3.14).

In Kenya, 71 percent of recipients of agricultural payments were paid digitally, as
were 63 percent in Senegal and 33 percent in Nigeria. Overall, 10 percent or more
of all adults in these three Sub-Saharan African economies receiving agricultural
payments did so in accounts, most often mobile money accounts. Compared with
that in 2021, the share of adults receiving agricultural payments in accounts more
than doubled in 2024 in Nigeria and Senegal.
Outside of Sub-Saharan Africa, Mongolia is the only economy in which 10 percent
or more of all adults received agricultural payments in accounts, reflecting nearly
100 percent of all agricultural payments in that economy.
Receiving money from and sending money to family and friends
People within families or social networks exchange money for various reasons.
These P2P payments can enable one person to help another through a difficult
period, or they may simply be reimbursements for purchases made by one person
on another’s behalf. The Global Findex survey questions related to such payments
do not specify the reasons for payments received from family members or friends.
They ask only whether respondents received money from or sent money to family
Payments 187
members or friends living in another city within their economies. In previous data
collection rounds, these payments were identified as domestic remittances rather
than by the broader term P2P payments.27
In low- and middle-income economies in which questions related to P2P payments
were asked, 32 percent of adults sent or received such payments from friends or
family members living within the same economy but in a different city.28 Most adults
(62 percent) sending or receiving such payments did so digitally. This includes adults
who reported sending payments directly from or receiving them directly on their
mobile phones, which might involve a mobile money account or app.
Domestic P2P payments are most common in Sub-Saharan Africa, where 52 percent
of adults sent or received such payments (refer to figure 3.3.15). The region also has
the highest share of such payments being made or received digitally, at 71 percent.
In 23 economies in Sub-Saharan Africa, more than half of adults sent or received
domestic P2P payments. They include Ghana and Senegal, the economies with the
largest shares of adults sending or receiving such payments, at 78 and 76 percent,
respectively. In both of these economies, more than 80 percent of those sending or
receiving P2P payments did so using accounts or phones. These high rates may be
self-perpetuating, as more people sending and receiving these payments leverage
digital channels, creating a network effect.29
Outside of Sub-Saharan Africa, in every region except for the Middle East and
North Africa, more than half of those sending or receiving domestic P2P payments
did so using accounts or phones. In the Middle East and North Africa, however,
only 34 percent did.
27 Chapter 4.2 discusses data on receipt of international remittances, that is, those from friends and family
members living in another country. Because less than 10 percent of adults in low- and middle-income economies
receive international remittance payments, the Global Findex does not collect data on the mode of transfer.
28 In low- and middle-income economies in which questions related to P2P payments were asked, 20 percent of
adults sent such payments and 24 percent of adults received them, including 12 percent of adults who both sent
and received such payments.

Opportunities remain to leverage payment digitalization to
increase all aspects of financial inclusion, including access, use,
and financial health
There has been a focused effort across economies over the past 10 years to
digitalize government payments, motivated by the potential to reduce costs and
loss and increase government accountability.30
Across economies, financial inclusion has been boosted by the digitalization of G2P
and private sector wage payments. Sending these payments digitally is a proven
way to increase account ownership, given that 43 percent of all adults in low- and
middle-income economies—or 60 percent of those with an account at a bank or
similar financial institution—opened their first account to receive either a G2P
payment or a private sector wage payment (refer to figure 3.3.16).31 Women and
men were equally likely to become financially included in this way.

Opportunities remain to take advantage of this association between G2P and
wage payments and account ownership, given that 14 percent of all recipients of
government payments and slightly less than half of recipients of private sector
wage payments still receive these payments in cash or some other way (such as
a voucher). Some of the cash recipients already have an account (62 percent) and
own a mobile phone (75 percent), including 47 percent who own a smartphone
(refer to figure 3.3.17). Those who have accounts could immediately start
receiving their payments digitally, if their governments or employers could
deliver them and the recipients were willing to receive them that way. People
who do not yet have accounts but own mobile phones could be offered digitally
enabled accounts for receiving these payments. Thorough onboarding, guidance
in how to use such accounts, and a clear explanation of associated rules and
fees are essential to ensuring people get the most out of them.

Digital payments help increase people’s ability to meet
their needs, a key condition for financial health
Digital payments also offer untapped opportunities to help people manage their
money more effectively and thereby improve their financial health, a topic explored
in the next section. One example of such an opportunity is payment fractionalization,
or breaking up large one-time payments into smaller, more frequent, and more
manageable installments.
For instance, parents who send their children to schools that charge tuition or that
require parents to pay for books or other supplies often must pay these fees all
at once at the beginning of a semester. That can put significant pressure on tight
budgets. Smallholder farmers similarly must also buy supplies at the start of the
growing season, when they have limited resources because of the months-long
gap since the previous harvest. Digital tools that enable more flexible, incremental
payments could thus help households smooth expenses, ease financial stress, and
reduce the need for short-term borrowing.
Furthermore, as highlighted throughout this chapter, account owners have frequent
and varied opportunities to use digital payments. Doing so helps habituate them
to using accounts, not just to make and receive various payment types, but also for
accessing a broader range of financial opportunities. This includes saving, which can
be thought of as a payment to oneself, and borrowing, with repayments that can be
automated.
As individuals expand and deepen their use of financial services, account owners
may find they are better able to manage financial stress, build resilience against
financial shocks, and strengthen their financial confidence. These are all hallmarks
of financial health, explored in the next and final section of this report.

SPOTLIGHT 3.1
Account usage and inactivity
Although owning an account is a critical first step to participating in the greater
financial system, to fully benefit from access to finance, account owners should be
able to use their accounts to store money and make and receive payments. This
spotlight explores how often people use their accounts—and whether they use
them at all.
Account activity is high in low- and middle-income economies,
with exceptions
The data in section 3 highlight the different ways account owners use their
accounts to save, borrow, and make and receive payments. Yet 6 percent of adults
in low- and middle-income economies—8 percent of account owners—have only
what could be considered inactive accounts. The Global Findex defines inactive
accounts as those into or out of which no deposits, withdrawals, or incoming
or outgoing digital payments have been received or made in the past year.1
The average 6 percent account inactivity in 2024 is similar to the percentage
in 2021.
The share of adults whose accounts are inactive varies across low- and
middle-income economies. It is especially high in India, where 14 percent of
adults—16 percent of account owners—do not have an active account (refer to
figure S3.1.1). If India is excluded from the low- and middle-income average, the
share of adults who do not have an active account falls to 3 percent, or 4 percent of
account owners.
1 In Algeria, China, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Libya, Mauritius, and Ukraine, where an abridged questionnaire
was administered, account inactivity was defined as cases in which adults with an account had not made a digital
payment, had not made a digital merchant payment, and had not accessed their account via a debit or credit card
or phone in the past year. Because of a lack of data, the average for low- and middle-income economies excludes
the Russian Federation.

Note: In Algeria, China, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Libya, Mauritius, and Ukraine, where an abridged

had not made a digital payment, had not made a digital merchant payment, and had not accessed their
account via a debit or credit card or phone in the past year. Because of a lack of data, the average for
low- and middle-income economies excludes the Russian Federation.
India has made progress in increasing the share of adults with active accounts
Despite its comparatively low rate of active accounts, both the absolute number and
the percentage of adults with active accounts in India has increased. In addition,
more men than women own active accounts, though the gender gap in ownership
of active accounts as a percentage of account owners fell from 12 percentage points
in 2021 to 7 percentage points in 2024 (refer to figure S3.1.2). This decrease may be
due to the large increase over the same period in women receiving government-
to-person (G2P) payments digitally, from 13 percent in 2021 (59 percent of women
receiving a G2P payment) to 24 percent in 2024 (81 percent of women receiving
a G2P payment).

Data on frequency of usage suggest cash is still dominant
The issue of account activity broadly relates to the role of transaction frequency
and patterns of account use. To provide data for a better understanding of this,
the Global Findex 2025 asks, separately, adults with accounts at banks or similar
financial institutions and adults with mobile money accounts in Sub-Saharan Africa
about how often in a typical month they deposit money into their accounts and
how frequently they withdraw or send money—including as a payment—from their
accounts.
Account usage and inactivity 199
Frequency of usage of bank and similar financial institution accounts points
to transactions primarily in cash
When inflows are the focus, across low- and middle-income economies, the largest
share of owners of accounts at banks or similar financial institutions, 40 percent,
deposit money into their accounts at monthly intervals. These monthly deposits
might be wages from employers, government transfer payments, or money from
family living elsewhere. Only 11 percent of these account holders make deposits
weekly.
In comparison, 33 percent of adults with accounts at banks or similar financial
institutions send or withdraw money from their accounts monthly, whereas
19 percent do so weekly (refer to figure S3.1.3). In regions such as the Middle East
and North Africa, where the majority of adults both deposit and withdraw money
at monthly intervals, this pattern suggests that accounts are used primarily for
receiving payments. People typically receive wage or transfer payments once a
month, withdraw most or all of the money from those payments soon after, and
continue to transact primarily in cash.
When monthly inflows of deposits into an account are common but outflows occur
weekly or even more frequently, on the other hand, it might suggest the account
owner is making greater use of digital payments and other account-to-account
transfers.
Another possibility is that account owners use their accounts for safe storage of
money and withdraw cash weekly because they do not want too much cash on hand
for security reasons. In East Asia and Pacific, Europe and Central Asia, and Latin
America and the Caribbean, about 10 percent of adults had monthly inflows into
their accounts, but weekly outflows from them.
A more developed digital ecosystem could encourage people to keep money in their
accounts, enabling them to store it more safely, reducing impulse spending, and
increasing the convenience of making digital payments.

Frequency of usage of mobile money accounts in Sub-Saharan Africa points to
more use of digital payments
In Sub-Saharan Africa, where many adults own only a mobile money account,
the Global Findex 2025 includes similar questions on frequency of use of these
accounts. The data show that across the four Sub-Saharan African subregions,
adults with mobile money accounts deposit and send or withdraw money at higher
frequencies than those with accounts at banks or similar financial institutions (refer
to figure S3.1.4). This likely reflects the greater convenience and affordability of
depositing money through local mobile money agents, rather than traveling to
a bank branch or ATM.
Figure S3.1.4 Among mobile money account owners in Sub-Saharan Africa,

202 The Global Findex Database 2025
In all subregions with the exception of Central Africa, more than half of adults with
mobile money accounts deposit and send or withdraw money at least once a month.
Furthermore, about 20 percent make weekly deposits, whereas about 30 percent
withdraw or send money at least weekly. The fact that a larger share of owners of
mobile money accounts have weekly outflows compared with the share that have
weekly inflows suggests that mobile money is especially effective for facilitating
frequent transactions, such as sending money or engaging in purchases, making it a
convenient platform for everyday digital payments.
These patterns of account use across low- and middle-income economies
offer important insights into how people manage their money and use
financial services. Although many adults deposit funds on a monthly basis,
with the frequency perhaps dictated by wage or government transfer cycles,
the frequency of withdrawals and payments varies, shaped by differences in
infrastructure, convenience, and digital ecosystems. In Sub-Saharan Africa,
mobile money facilitates more frequent transactions, highlighting its role as a
convenient channel for day-to-day financial activity. These usage patterns have
direct implications for financial health, such as how people manage liquidity,
meet financial goals, and cope with shocks, which will be explored in the
next section.

4.1 Managing financial worrying
A major motivation for promoting connectivity, financial access, and use of financial
services is to establish the conditions needed to increase people’s financial health,
defined as the ability to meet financial needs without undue stress, pursue goals,
deal with financial shocks, and otherwise feel confident managing finances (refer to
box 4.1.1). In today’s environment, digital and financial inclusion would, in theory,
make financial health much easier to attain, though neither type of inclusion
offers a guarantee, given other necessary conditions, such as consumer financial
protection, financial literacy, and consumer-friendly design of financial products.
In order to understand more about people’s financial health and identify the
barriers they face to improving it, the Global Findex 2025 asked adults what they
worry about in regard to their finances, whether they would be able to manage a
financial “shock” such as an accident or a loss of income, and whether they have
the financial skills and confidence needed to use financial services to their benefit.
This chapter explores the issues around financial worrying.
Box 4.1.1 Defining financial health
Though many aspects of financial health are subjective, the Group of Twenty’s Global
Partnership for Financial Inclusion and the UN Secretary-General’s Special Advocate
for Financial Health, Queen Máxima of the Netherlands, have helped form consensus
on four factors that reflect financial health.a Financially healthy people can do the
following things:
• Manage financial needs and obligations
• Pursue aspirations, fulfill goals, and capture opportunities
• Cope with financial shocks
• Feel satisfied and confident about their financial lives.
The Global Findex 2025 asked a series of questions that align with these indicators of
financial health in a way that attempts to capture objective measures of them.
For most high-income economies and the Russian Federation, however, the survey
included only questions on account ownership. As a result, this chapter does not
report global or high-income economy averages. The “Methodology” tab of the
Global Findex website (http://globalfindex.worldbank.org) provides details on the
information collected in each surveyed economy.

Monthly expenses are the main source of financial stress for
the largest share of people
Many people worry about having the financial resources to meet their needs,
including people who would not seem to have much to worry about. Financial
stress is at once universal and highly subjective. People with limited resources in
particular worry about financial issues, from paying everyday bills to dealing with
medical issues or saving for the future. Yet two people with objectively similar
financial situations but in distinct contexts or with different personalities might each
experience financial concerns in their own way. Some people hesitate to express
money worries; others are simply more anxious than their peers. Two people may
also feel financial stress more or less acutely because they assign different priority
levels to different parts of their lives.
Acknowledging worry’s subjective nature, the Global Findex 2025 asked respondents
about which common sources of financial stress concern them most: monthly
expenses such as food, housing, or bills; medical costs; school fees; money for old
age; and money to support a business. Under the Group of Twenty’s definition
of financial health, medical bills and monthly household expenses are needs and
obligations, whereas money to support a business, school fees, and money for old
age relate more closely to the pursuit of goals and opportunities, given the delayed
returns on investment provided by money used for these purposes.
The questions asked about financial worries in this round of the Global Findex
changed slightly from those in the 2021 survey, which asked first if respondents
were very or somewhat worried about any of the first four financial issues (the
2021 survey did not include the option of business expenses as a source of worry),
then asked them which was the biggest worry. In 2021, in low- and middle-income
economies, about 74 percent of adults said they felt concerned about at least one of
the issues, and more than 20 percent said they were very worried about all four.
The Global Findex 2025, however, simply asked respondents to name their biggest
financial worry among the issues offered, with no option to say they did not worry
about any of them. According to the results, larger shares of people worry about
covering their needs and obligations than about their longer-term goals. This could
be because their immediate needs are too urgent to allow them to think in the longer
term, or because they could feel more secure about their longer-term prospects.
Whichever it might be, across low- and middle-income economies, 30 percent and
26 percent of adults, respectively, are most worried about monthly expenses and
medical costs, whereas 14 percent of adults each are most worried about school
212 The Global Findex Database 2025
fees and having money for old age. Among all adults, 9 percent worry most about
business expenses; this number increases to 13 percent among self-employed
adults.
Monthly expenses are the most frequently cited financial worry in Latin America
and the Caribbean, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa. Medical costs tops the list
in East Asia and Pacific and is equally prevalent with monthly expenses as a source
of worry in Europe and Central Asia and the Middle East and North Africa (refer to
figure 4.1.1). The financial pressure posed by medical costs is not new: these costs
were the biggest source of financial stress for most adults in the Global Findex 2021
in every world region, with their urgency possibly exacerbated by the recency of the
COVID-19 pandemic.1

1 As noted earlier, the Global Findex survey fielded in 2024 structured the questions on financial worrying slightly
differently from those in the 2021 survey. As such, the results are not one-to-one comparable and should not be
considered a time series, though they can still offer directional insights.
Managing financial worrying 213
School fees preoccupy about 20 percent of adults in South Asia and Sub-Saharan
Africa. Within the latter group, that share is even higher in the subregion of Central
Africa at 24 percent (refer to figure 4.1.2). The high share in these two regions may
be because private schools are an essential educational option there or because
even public schools in certain economies in these regions require that families cover
the costs of uniforms, supplies, and meals, among other school-related expenses.2
People in a given economy may worry about very different issues than the average
adult in the same region. For example, even though a smaller share of people worry
primarily about medical expenses in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa than in other
regions, those expenses are the top concern for the largest share of adults in the
Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Mauritius, and Nepal. Adults in the Comoros, Kenya,
Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Uganda are

Monthly expenses, medical costs, and school fees are still the top concerns in all
regions for adults living in the poorest 40 percent and the wealthiest 60 percent
of households by income. In a few instances, however, the prevalence of a
specific issue shifts for an income group. For example, in South Asia, school
fees are the second-most-prevalent worry for wealthier adults, nudging out
medical expenses. In Europe and Central Asia, saving for old age occupies third
place among wealthier adults, taking precedence by 10 percentage points over
the fourth-place worry, school fees.
Borrowing, saving, and insurance could offer people more
options for managing needs and pursuing goals
Financial services provide ways for people to manage their financial lives and
potentially mitigate their financial worries.
Insurance is the financial product most clearly associated with helping people
mitigate stress and manage risk. Insurance coverage is difficult to assess in a survey
such as the Global Findex, however, because definitions and availability of insurance
products vary widely among economies. For example, life insurance refers to term
saving products in some places, instead of payments made at death as it does in
many others. To avoid confusion around variable definitions, this edition of the
Global Findex survey simply asked whether respondents have made any payments
to an insurance agent or company.
The responses show that 23 percent of adults across low- and middle-income
economies pay an insurer. Payments can be made for a range of insurance
products, including life, health, home, and car insurance, as well as saving-
oriented products such as policies that help parents save for their children’s
education. Adults from the poorest 40 percent of households are 10 percentage
points less likely than adults from the wealthiest 60 percent to make insurance
payments. If China were excluded from the average for low- and middle-
income economies, the insurance payment rate would fall by more than half to
11 percent, because more than half of adults in China have a relationship with an
insurer. Among low- and middle-income economies, only Mongolia has a similar
rate of adults paying an insurer.
If China is excluded from East Asia and Pacific, paying an insurer is most common in
Europe and Central Asia, where 18 percent of adults do, and slightly less common
than the average in South Asia, where only 9 percent do.
Managing financial worrying 215
Some borrow to address their everyday needs
Borrowing is another way for people to meet immediate needs and pursue longer-
term goals. Borrowing is sometimes a last resort when people do not have enough
available cash to cover an expense. This could be an everyday expense, such as
household items needed between paydays, or a larger expense, such as a home or
car repair. Many people deal with this type of situation using informal credit, such
as that from family or friends.3 Informal loans may or may not incur interest but
likely come with the social expectation that the borrower will lend money in turn to
the lender when asked. Although this expectation might reflect the typical actions in
a tight-knit social network whose members support one another, it can also create a
cycle that prevents members from reaching their saving goals.4
Borrowing for everyday needs is fairly common. For example, in low- and middle-
income economies, 22 percent of adults have purchased groceries on credit. How
common this practice is varies widely by region. Almost no one buys groceries
on credit in East Asia and Pacific, whereas in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa,
40 percent of adults do.
The tendency to make purchases on credit is higher among people in low- and
middle-income economies living in the poorest 40 percent of households by income,
at 25 percent of adults, compared with 20 percent of adults in the wealthiest
60 percent of households. The difference by income group is about 10 percentage
points in Europe and Central Asia, where 22 percent of adults in the poorest
40 percent of households buy groceries on credit compared with 13 percent of those
in the wealthiest 60 percent of households, and in South Asia, where 48 percent of
the poorest and 37 percent of the wealthiest adults do. The fact that people borrow
for basic needs like food serves as a reminder that some people continue to live
payday to payday.5
Beyond everyday needs, when people do not have sufficient savings for a health
emergency, they might also turn to loans, family or friends, or, in a few places,
credit cards. About 20 percent of adults in low- and middle-income economies
borrowed money for health reasons in the year prior to taking the survey. That
is one-third of the 60 percent who borrowed for any purpose, about the same
share as in 2021.
3 Only 40 percent of borrowers in low- and middle-income economies borrow formally. See chapter 3.2 for more
details.

216 The Global Findex Database 2025
Medical borrowing is higher in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa than in other
regions, despite a smaller share of adults naming medical expenses as their primary
worry in these regions, and the difference is statistically significant. Most people
who borrow for health reasons do so informally, given that only a small share of
them answered in the affirmative when asked if they borrowed formally in the year
before the survey. Only in East Asia and Pacific did more than half of adults who
borrowed for medical purposes also borrow formally at 54 percent of borrowers, or
7 percent of all adults in the region (the survey does not enable a determination of
whether the formal credit was used for medical purposes).
In every region, a larger share of adults living in the poorest 40 percent of
households by income borrowed for medical purposes than the share of adults
living in the wealthiest 60 percent (refer to figure 4.1.3). This is in line with existing
research suggesting that lower-income people experience greater pressure on
household finances from medical bills and often lack income-preserving options for
dealing with them, such as affordable and comprehensive health insurance.6

Managing financial worrying 217
In the absence of health insurance, appropriate credit to cover health care costs in the
short term could ensure people get the care they need without cutting into household
budgets for food or shelter, with the acknowledgment that debt service would add a
regular expense that might not be viable for some household budgets. Such an option
should also be promoted cautiously, as adults who borrow to cover existing expenses
risk becoming overindebted, with negative effects on their financial health.7
Borrowing may also help people pursue goals and opportunities, such as building
or growing a business. About 11 percent of respondents, or one in six borrowers,
in low- and middle-income economies borrowed for a business. Borrowing for
business purposes is most prevalent overall in Sub-Saharan Africa, where 16 percent
of adults (more than one in five borrowers in the region) borrowed money for such
purposes (refer to figure 4.1.4).
As with borrowing for medical purposes, most of the adults who borrowed for a
business borrowed only informally (it is not known if those who did have access to
formal credit used it for business purposes). In Sub-Saharan Africa, though the share
of adults who borrowed for a business was the largest of any region, the smallest
share of them had access to formal borrowing compared with those in other regions.
It may be that business owners in the region have fewer options for formal credit
than business owners in East Asia and Pacific and Latin America and the Caribbean,
where about 70 percent of adults who borrowed for business purposes also had
access to formal credit through a financial institution, digital credit, or a credit card.

Saving for old age can help mitigate worry about the future
Saving for a specific purpose offers another way for people to manage their
financial priorities. For example, across low- and middle-income economies,
18 percent of adults save formally in an account and save for old age. Of adults
who report money for old age as their primary financial worry, 29 percent save
specifically for this purpose.
The data show sharp regional differences in regard to saving for old age (refer to
figure 4.1.5). More than a third of adults in East Asia and Pacific save for old age—a
share whose large size is driven by the 43 percent of adults in China saving for this
purpose—compared with less than 10 percent in Latin America and the Caribbean,
the Middle East and North Africa, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa.
Saving for old age might be difficult, especially because it has a long time horizon
and requires long-term commitment to keeping in savings the money intended
for use in retirement. Such saving competes with more immediate needs and is
particularly hard for people who might need to dip into savings to meet urgent
medical or educational expenses or who do not have the ability to store money in a
place where it cannot be withdrawn.
Long-term saving is even harder where social insurance is necessary, that is, where
a person needs to offer their savings to family or friends so that next time they help
you. There might also be expectations of support from children or public pension
schemes, which can make saving for old age less of a priority.

Opportunities exist to leverage financial services to manage
financial stress
Although the data show that some people use insurance, borrowing, and saving to
address their financial needs and pursue their goals, the fact that most borrowers
do so using informal methods suggests opportunities to connect people’s needs or
goals more effectively with financial services.
Insurance is one area of opportunity, specifically health insurance. Given the
high level of stress people feel about medical expenses, there is clearly an unmet
demand for ways to get needed health care without sacrificing financial stability.
This need is particularly acute among poorer households.
Another clear opportunity is encouraging saving. Some research even finds that
emergency savings are a strong predictor of financial health.8 Generic savings
accounts can encourage people to save money to achieve their financial goals9 and
increase their ability to cope with unexpected expenses;10 commitment savings
accounts—those that include “nudging” features to provide account holders with
incentives for saving—help increase the amount people save.11 Informal savings
are also shifting to formal accounts, as more affordable and accessible options
become available, including ones leveraging mobile technology, as discussed in
chapter 3.1.
Though encouraging saving among the poor may be thought of as challenging
given their low incomes, research finds that even very poor people are able to
save when given the tools to do so, including affordable accounts with no or low
transaction fees for small deposits.12
Global Findex 2025 data on what private sector earners do with wages paid into
their accounts also suggest opportunities. As discussed in chapter 3.3, 32 percent
of adults in low- and middle-income economies receive wage payments in
financial accounts,13 and about 36 percent of those receiving wage payments in
accounts—or 12 percent of all adults—leave some of that money in their accounts.
The share of adults leaving money in accounts is higher than the average in
East Asia and Pacific (16 percent), Europe and Central Asia (23 percent), and
8 Costa, de la Fuente, and Martino (2025).

Latin America and the Caribbean (17 percent). Behavioral incentives might persuade
more people to earmark some of that money for savings, and even for specific
purposes, including saving for old age.
Additional incentives, such as awarding interest to people who meet certain
thresholds for amounts saved or matching the amounts they save, may likewise
help grow savings balances. These balances are key not only for pursuing goals, but
also for managing the financial stress that can come from an emergency, loss of
income, or financial shock: the area of financial health explored in the next section.

4.2 Financial resilience

4.2 Financial resilience
General worrying or financial stress reflects a continuous state of anxiety. Reacting
to economic “shocks,” on the other hand, is in another category. Often triggered by
a sudden loss of income or a major expense, economic shocks often force people to
access extra money beyond what they typically need to cover everyday expenses or
fill an ongoing income gap.
Aligned with the Group of Twenty’s aspect of financial health1 related to improving
people’s ability to cope with negative economic shocks, the Global Findex asked
whether respondents could access an amount of money equal to 5 percent of their
country’s per capita gross national income within 30 days. This would be about
$4,000 in the United States, 54,000 kwachas in Malawi, 12,000 pesos in Mexico, and
so on. The survey first asked respondents about the main source of funding for this
amount, and then in a follow-up question, about how difficult it would be to come
up with this funding in the next 30 days. The Global Findex 2025 classifies people as
financially resilient when they can access this amount of money and doing so would
not be difficult at all or only somewhat difficult.
Financial resilience in the face of shocks has remained the same
since 2021
On average, 56 percent of adults in low- and middle-income economies could access
extra money without much difficulty (refer to figure 4.2.1), the same percentage
as in 2021. Yet there were modest increases in resilience in Latin America and
the Caribbean and the Middle East and North Africa, where it climbed by 6 and
4 percentage points, respectively.

1 Refer to box 4.1.1 for the definition of financial health used to frame the data described in this chapter.
225
Family or friends continue to be a dominant source of extra money
People rely on different sources for extra money: family or friends; savings; additional
work hours; borrowing from a financial institution, an employer, or a private lender;
and selling assets. In most economies, at least 98 percent of people say they would
tap one of these resources for emergency funds, although a small share say the
money would be impossible to get despite these efforts.
Family or friends are the most common source of extra money, relied on by
31 percent of adults in low- and middle-income economies. This could include
people who are local or those who live in other countries (refer to box 4.2.1).
In some places, a much higher share of adults turn to family or friends. In the
Middle East and North Africa, for example, more than 50 percent of people say
they would rely on family or friends (refer to figure 4.2.2, panel d). In 34 economies
with diverse geographies and income levels, more than 40 percent of adults name
family or friends as their first source of extra money. Examples include Bangladesh,
The Gambia, Iraq, Mexico, Kosovo, and Viet Nam.
Box 4.2.1 The role of remittances in increasing resilience
International remittances provide numerous benefits to both sending and receiving
countries. For those who receive them, they offer essential financial support,
contributing to poverty reduction, increased consumption, and greater access to
education, health care, and housing.a In addition, many adults rely on payments from
family or friends living inside their country, as discussed in chapter 3.3.
Although the volume of international remittances is often large, the share of adults
who receive them is less than 10 percent globally. In 60 low- and middle-income
economies included in the Global Findex 2025, 10 percent or more of adults receive
them (refer to figure B4.2.1.1). This includes 13 percent of adults in Sub-Saharan
Africa and 12 percent of adults in Europe and Central Asia. The five economies with
the highest share of adults receiving international remittances are the Dominican
Republic, The Gambia, Kosovo, Senegal, and Tajikistan.
Evidence from low- and middle-income economies shows the importance of
international remittances for increasing household financial resilience. Remittances
act as informal insurance, helping recipient households smooth consumption and
cope with adverse shocks such as job loss, health emergencies, natural disasters,
and economic downturns.

Note: Because an abridged questionnaire was administered in Algeria, China, the Islamic Republic
of Iran, Libya, Mauritius, the Russian Federation, and Ukraine, averages exclude data for these
economies.
For example, in the Philippines, remittances increase in response to adverse income
shocks, such as poor rainfall, acting as a countercyclical insurance mechanism that
smooths consumption and buffers against income losses.b Furthermore, there is
evidence that remittance-receiving households are more likely to invest in health,
education, and small businesses, contributing to long-term financial stability and
economic mobility.c Overall, remittances can serve as a key mechanism for building
financial health.d

The Global Findex also asked about the difficulty of accessing extra funds. Among
adults who say that it is possible to get extra money, 36 percent also say it would be
very difficult to get it from any source: these adults are not resilient.
Even though family or friends are the most common source of extra money
in low- and middle-income economies, they are also among the least reliable
sources. About half of those who rely on them, or 15 percent of all adults, say the
money would be very difficult to get. In Namibia and the Philippines, where about
30 percent of adults rely on family or friends for extra money, three-quarters of
those who do rely on them say the money would be very difficult to get.

Financial resilience 229
There are exceptions to family or friends’ low levels of reliability, however. In
European and Central Asian economies such as Armenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina,
and Montenegro, which also have above-average reliance on family or friends,
they are more reliable. In these economies, no more than 20 percent of
adults who rely on family or friends for extra money say that it would be very
difficult to get.
Overall, the level of reliance on family or friends for extra money was the same
in low- and middle-income economies in 2024 as it was in 2021, in terms of both
the share of adults who rely on it and how difficult it would be to get the funds.
The challenges associated with raising money from family or friends may in part
reflect the fact that many events that would motivate people to reach out for help
affect an entire community. For example, natural disasters or extreme weather
events are becoming more frequent in low- and middle-income economies (refer
to spotlight 4.1 at the end of this section for a discussion of natural disasters).
After family or friends, savings and working extra hours are the second-most-
popular sources of emergency money, each preferred by about 20 percent of adults
across low- and middle-income economies.
The share of adults who can reliably draw money from savings increased by
4 percentage points between 2021 and 2024, which might be related to increases
in overall saving rates (formal and informal) of 12 percentage points reported in
chapter 3.1.2 Among adults with any savings in low- and middle-income economies,
a third say that they would rely on those savings as a source of emergency money.
Of all adults, 21 percent say the same. Among adults who save formally, 38 percent
would rely on their savings in an emergency.
Savings are the most reliable source of extra money. Nearly all adults who rely
on them say they could access extra money to deal with a shock with little to
no difficulty. In East Asia and Pacific and Europe and Central Asia, where overall
resilience remained steady, the share of adults who reported having reliable
savings to draw from increased by 6 and 5 percentage points, respectively (refer
to figure 4.2.3). In East Asia and Pacific, this increase coincided with a decrease in
reliance on working for extra money to mitigate a financial shock, and in Europe
and Central Asia, with decreased reliance on borrowing.
2 Recall that as discussed in chapter 3.1, an increase in the saving rate refers to the share of adults who save,
not how much they save.

As mentioned, the same share of adults rely on extra work as rely on savings for
extra money. Not surprisingly, employment status influences this reliance. Among
adults who receive wages, 20 percent say they would rely on work—the same as
the overall average. Yet 27 percent of self-employed adults would rely on work.
That compares with 15 percent of unemployed adults and 11 percent of adults who
are out of the workforce. Wage- and self-employed adults who rely on work for extra
money are more likely than the average to say the money would not be hard to
get. A quarter of men in low- and middle-income economies would work for extra
money, compared with 18 percent of women.
Extra work is nonetheless less reliable than savings, with 7 percent of adults—or
one-third of those relying on it—saying the money would be very difficult to get. This
may be because in many economies, working more hours might not be possible,
especially for people in tight labor markets with low demand for their skills.
For those reasons and others, there is wide variation between the shares of adults
relying on savings and those relying on extra work, even in the same geographic
region. For example, savings are the option of choice for only 6 percent of adults in
Madagascar, compared with 30 percent of adults who choose extra work; in contrast,
20 percent of adults would rely on savings and 13 percent on work in Liberia.
Borrowing money and selling assets are much less popular than any of the other
sources of extra money, with 7 percent and 9 percent of adults, respectively,
Financial resilience 231
in low- and middle-income economies relying on them in 2024. Both percentages
are up slightly since 2021, when 5 percent of adults said they would borrow, and
4 percent said they would sell assets to get emergency cash.
More than 10 percent of adults would borrow to deal with a shock in just
18 economies. These include the Dominican Republic and Malawi, where more
than 20 percent of adults report that they would borrow emergency money.
A larger share of adults who borrow and a larger share of those who sell assets say
these methods are less reliable than do those who save or rely on family or friends
as ways to access extra cash.
Sources of funding for accessing extra money differ according
to economies’ income group
As was the case in 2021, an economy’s income group classification did not
necessarily correlate with respondents’ financial resilience in the 2024 survey
(refer to figure 4.2.4). In Burkina Faso and Togo, both low-income economies,
a higher share of adults were resilient than the average across low- and middle-
income economies. Their resilience rates were also higher than those in economies
such as Eswatini and Nigeria, both lower middle income, and Botswana and
Namibia, which are upper middle income.
Adults in upper-middle-income economies are more likely overall to be able to
get extra money than adults in low- and lower-middle-income economies (refer to
figure 4.2.5). They are also more likely to rely on savings and less likely to sell their
assets or ask family or friends for money.
Figure 4.2.4 Income group classification does not reliably correlate with

A third of adults in upper-middle-income economies rely on savings, more than
20 percentage points more than in low- and lower-middle-income economies,
where 12 percent of adults do. Data from China, where 39 percent of adults rely
on savings, drive the high level of reliance on savings in upper-middle-income
economies. When data from China are excluded, 16 percent of adults in the upper-
middle-income group of countries rely on savings.
In contrast, in low-income economies, 22 percent of adults would sell assets to
manage a shock. In comparison, 12 percent of adults in lower-middle-income
economies and 5 percent in upper-middle-income economies would sell assets.
Some economies vary from this norm. In lower-middle-income Tanzania, for
instance, 29 percent would sell assets, making it the top choice for funding an
emergency in that economy.
Women and low-income adults rely more than men and
high-income adults on family or friends for extra money
Financial resilience and sources of emergency money differ according to gender and
household income (refer to figure 4.2.6). Across low- and middle-income economies,
women and men are equally likely to rely on savings, borrowing, or selling assets for
money in an emergency. But women are 6 percentage points more likely to rely on
family or friends and 7 percentage points less likely to work for extra money. The gap
between women’s and men’s reliance on work is more than 15 percentage points
in nine economies, four of them in Europe and Central Asia: Algeria, Azerbaijan,
Bangladesh, Guinea, Niger, Tajikistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, and West Bank and Gaza.

There are also differences according to income. In low- and middle-income
economies, adults living in households in the poorest 40 percent by income are less
likely than those in the wealthiest 60 percent to rely on savings for extra money:
15 percent compared with 26 percent. Poorer adults are not significantly more likely
to rely on family or friends (33 percent versus 30 percent), nor are they less likely to
seek additional work (20 percent versus 23 percent) than their wealthier peers.
One-third of adults could cover more than two months of
expenses if they lost their main income source
For the first time in 2024, the Global Findex asked how long people could cover their
household expenses if they lost their main income source. About one in three adults
in low- and middle-income economies, or 34 percent, said they could cover everyday
expenses for more than two months if that happened (refer to figure 4.2.7). About
half as many, 17 percent, could cover just about two months. One in four, or
26 percent, could cover one month, and 19 percent could cover less than two weeks.

The length of time that respondents could cover their expenses varies by region.
The largest share of adults in East Asia and Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean,
the Middle East and North Africa, and Sub-Saharan Africa could cover more than two
months of expenses if they lost their main source of income. In Europe and Central
Asia and South Asia, in contrast, the largest share of adults could cover only about a
month of expenses.
Increasing resilience by building confidence
The trends discussed in chapter 3.1 point toward more adults saving in an account.
Over time, as this saving trend continues, it may translate into greater resilience,
as more people amass sufficient balances to manage an unexpected expense or
loss of income.
Financial confidence, including the ability to manage money and navigate the
functions of an account, may also help people make the most of the money they
have and maximize their ability to save. That is the subject of the next chapter.

4.3 Gaps in financial capabilities and confidence
After managing daily needs, pursuing longer-term goals, and preparing for
unexpected shocks, feeling confident about one’s financial life is recognized as a
key aspect of financial health, as defined by the Group of Twenty. Like financial
worrying, financial confidence is subjective, shaped by a person’s perceptions about
their own financial capabilities.
Despite this subjectivity, the Global Findex 2025 attempts to measure financial
confidence by asking about behaviors and experiences that suggest people
understand how to use their financial accounts and can do so responsibly and
confidently. Paying unexpected fees, sending erroneous transactions, relying on
others to transact on one’s behalf, or expecting to need help to use an account
can all result in a lack of confidence in one’s ability to use financial services
independently. In contrast, people taking proactive steps to manage and safeguard
their money tend to show both greater capability and higher levels of confidence.
Yet even when individual experiences are acknowledged, a strong and enforced
consumer protection framework is a prerequisite for financial confidence and
capability. Financial education and personal financial capability are important and
have positive impacts.1 Yet they are insufficient on their own, and can put too much
of an onus on the consumer to navigate financial markets that are often confusing
and opaque. Many of the challenges discussed in this chapter, such as unexpected
fees or relying on others to navigate financial services, often arise from exploitative
pricing practices, poor product design, or a lack of transparency, and not from
individual mistakes or ignorance.
For instance, research using mystery shoppers has consistently documented hidden
fees, inadequate disclosure of prices and taxes, and unresponsive customer service
and complaint mechanisms, particularly in digital financial services such as mobile
money.2 Even when users are aware of official fee structures, they may still overpay
as a result of unofficial agent charges or misleading sales tactics.
Financial confidence, therefore, requires a fair financial playing field, one in
which users not only understand the rules, but also operate in an environment
in which those rules are enforced and abusive practices are curbed. This broader
perspective reinforces the view of financial education and consumer protection as
complementary, not interchangeable.

Unexpected fees and erroneous transactions suggest that some
adults are financially vulnerable
The Global Findex 2025 asked people who receive a government payment or
a private sector wage in an account whether they have paid a higher-than-
expected fee to collect their money. The data do not indicate whether such fees,
when reported, reflect a recipient’s misunderstanding about the fee structure or
exploitation by a payment distributor.
Either way, having paid such fees might point to a potential lack of understanding
of account rules or a lack of knowledge about recourse options if an account
owner encounters difficulties. This highlights the importance of addressing both
the inevitability of some fees and the preventability of others through improved
regulation and provider practices, as well as increased consumer awareness.
Across low- and middle-income economies,3 5 percent of adults paid higher-than-
expected fees. In nine economies,10 percent or more of adults paid higher-than-
expected fees: Armenia, Bulgaria, Eswatini, Kenya, the Kyrgyz Republic, Malaysia,
Morocco, Senegal, and South Africa. Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest share of
government payment recipients paying unexpected fees to collect their money, at
nearly one in four; Europe and Central Asia has the lowest share, at just one in ten.
In every region, wage payment recipients are more likely than government payment
recipients to pay an unexpected fee (refer to figure 4.3.1). Latin America and the
Caribbean and Sub-Saharan Africa have the highest shares of wage payment
recipients paying extra fees, at about one in four and one in three, respectively.
Those who receive government transfers or wage payments often have limited
or no choice about how they get paid. As a result, some unexpected fees may be
unavoidable, making them less influenced by an individual’s financial knowledge or
behavior. Not all unexpected fees are inevitable, however. Regulatory agencies and
financial services providers can help minimize exploitative pricing, control agent
misconduct, and increase transparency and disclosure around pricing structures.
This includes clearer disclosures of taxes, fees, and the consequences of using
services such as out-of-network ATMs.
In addition, the cost of financial services can be reduced if consumers are equipped
with the tools and information necessary to compare prices and select more
affordable options among those available. Increased access to comparable pricing
data and greater financial literacy can empower individuals to make more cost-
effective financial decisions.

Mistakes are common, though potentially avoidable
Though fees are not entirely avoidable, mistakes may be. The Global Findex asked
mobile money account owners if they have ever sent money to the wrong recipient.
This can happen when an account owner inputs the wrong phone number or a
wrong version of another proxy ID before making a payment. Few adults in Latin
America and the Caribbean or South Asia have sent money to the wrong recipient,
despite these regions’ 37 percent and 22 percent mobile money account ownership
rates, respectively. In Sub-Saharan Africa, however, 9 percent of people—nearly a
quarter of mobile money account owners—have (refer to figure 4.3.2).

issue is resolved. In addition, providers
have included safeguards to prevent
mistaken transfers, including confirmation messages, as well as campaigns and
training to educate customers in ways to prevent mistaken transfers, as well as
to protect their PINs and avoid fraud.4
Relying on others to transact suggests a lack of financial capability
Anyone can accidentally enter the wrong phone number or other ID number for
an intended recipient of a mobile payment. Distraction, mistaken information, or
poor user experience design can all make that more likely, even for experienced
mobile money users. Account owners having family members or friends transact
for them, on the other hand, suggests a more distinct lack of financial capability
or autonomy.

For example, for this edition, the Global Findex survey included a set of questions
asked only in South Asia of adults who receive government payments in a
bank account. The question asked whether the recipients withdraw the money
themselves or rely on a friend or a family member to do it for them. Among adults
in the region who receive government payments in a bank account, 17 percent rely
on a family member to withdraw the money (refer to figure 4.3.3). Women who
receive these payments are equally as likely as men who are recipients to make their
own withdrawals.
Responsible use of digital financial services both reflects and
enables greater financial confidence
Global Findex 2025 findings highlight the power of mobile connectivity for driving
not just increased digital activity, but also increased account ownership, saving,
and digital payments. These findings carry through to financial health in the form
of leveraging digital channels to engage in responsible financial practices. These
practices include keeping track of balances and staying informed about account
policies, while taking steps to protect accounts and the money in them.
Gaps in financial capabilities and confidence 243
Approximately 29 percent of all adults in low- and middle-income economies—or
40 percent of bank account owners in those economies—have received information
about their account balances through email, text, or some other method on their
mobile phones. A similar share of both adults and bank account owners have
proactively checked their bank balances using a mobile phone or computer (refer to
figure 4.3.4). Research suggests that this kind of real-time balance monitoring can
help customers build greater trust in their financial institutions.5
Receiving private information electronically makes it more important for users to
protect their mobile phones with passwords, a topic discussed in chapter 1.3. This is
particularly relevant for mobile money account owners, because even with a mobile
money account PIN, anyone with access to an account owner’s mobile phone—
whether a family member or a phone thief—could potentially access the balance in
the associated mobile money account.

A lack of financial confidence may discourage adults who do not
have accounts from opening one
The aspects of financial confidence discussed thus far focus on people who already
have accounts. Financial confidence may also affect the lives of people who do
not have accounts, however, and their willingness to open or use one. To provide
greater understanding about that, the Global Findex asked adults without an
account at a bank or similar financial institution whether they could use one without
help if they were to open one (respondents in Sub-Saharan Africa were not asked
this question because of the prevalence of mobile money accounts in the region).
Across regions, between 33 percent and 59 percent of these adults say they would
need help (refer to figure 4.3.6).
There are statistically significant gender differences across regions in the share of
adults without accounts at a bank or similar institution who say they would need
help using one. In Europe and Central Asia, the Middle East and North Africa,

and South Asia, women without an account at a bank or similar institution are
at least 19 percentage points more likely than men without such an account to
say they would need help using one if they opened one. In Latin America and the
Caribbean, that gap is 6 percentage points, whereas in East Asia and Pacific, there is
a 4 percentage point gender gap.
Regulators and financial institutions play a key role in helping
people build financial confidence
Empowering end users and rewarding behaviors that build financial confidence
requires collaboration among all parts of the digital and financial ecosystem,
including governments and policy makers, financial providers, device
manufacturers, and digital platforms.
Behaviors that indicate a lack of confidence, such as paying unexpected fees and
relying on others to collect money or otherwise use an account, can be mitigated
through experience, awareness building, and targeted financial education
programs. These may start among account owners themselves, who can be given
246 The Global Findex Database 2025
safe opportunities to build financial literacy through experience. For example,
evidence from an experiment involving women garment workers in Bangladesh
finds that first-time account owners who receive their wages in an account learn
quickly to use it competently.6
Yet the onus should not be put entirely on end users to independently develop
the skills they need to use financial services productively. Effective financial
account onboarding by providers may also help users, including those with less
experience, choose and use products that will give them the most benefit. Clear
information in plain language and through accessible media during the sales and
onboarding stages of financial product sign-up can ensure people understand the
products they sign up for and know how to use them. These types of interventions
theoretically benefit both end users and financial providers. Yet regulators
and supervisors may nonetheless have to spell out what they expect regulated
institutions to offer. In the absence of clear protocols, providers have an incentive
to sell the highest-function, highest-fee products, regardless of what a customer
needs. Customer service agents may also push higher-priced products, motivated
by commissions.
Product design and education also have a role to play. Digital products in particular
can help people using them through intuitive user interfaces, alerts, and prompts.
In the case of payments, people are less likely to send money to the wrong person if
a payment services provider builds identity verification and confirmation steps into
the payment process, thereby limiting the potential for mistakes.
Finally, as discussed at the beginning of this chapter, holistic, risk-based consumer
protection regimes are essential for setting the expectations and foundations
against which all financial services providers must deliver.7 By making these
regimes a priority, government regulators and supervisors can promote a safe and
productive financial inclusion environment for everyone.

SPOTLIGHT 4.1
Natural disasters, mobile connectivity, and
digital financial services
Worldwide, natural disasters have become more common. The annual number
of recorded droughts, floods, earthquakes, wildfires, volcanic events, tornadoes,
and similar events increased more than threefold between 1980 and 2023.1 Since
1980, the United States alone has experienced more than 400 natural disasters that
resulted in US$1 billion or more in damage.2
Every economy is exposed to natural disasters, though a combination of factors
make low- and middle-income economies disproportionately vulnerable to the
impacts of such disasters. These factors include vulnerable geography, as with island
economies, coastal economies, and nations experiencing desertification; extreme
temperatures; or both, as is the case in many low-latitude areas.3 Exposure to hazards
and rising temperatures has been associated historically with decreased economic
productivity,4 lower levels of consumption,5 and significant business losses.6
Within economies, poorer adults also face a threefold challenge: they often live in
places that are more exposed to disastrous events; they lose proportionally more
when disaster strikes; and they tend to have fewer resources to prepare for, cope
with, and recover from such events.7 Natural disasters are especially damaging
to financial access when they harm telecommunications infrastructure,8 making
communications and financial account access difficult, and when they damage
physical structures, including homes, government buildings, banks, and local
businesses where mobile agents operate.
Given the increased frequency of natural disasters and their potential impact on
both connectivity and financial access, the Global Findex 2025 includes questions
1 Our World in Data, ”Number of Recorded Natural Disaster Events, 1900 to 2023” (https://ourworldindata.org
/grapher/number-of-natural-disaster-events). Some of these increases reflect better data reporting rather than an
increase in the number of discrete events.

on experiences with natural disasters among people in low- and middle-income
economies. For the “World Risk Poll 2021: A Resilient World?” the Lloyd’s Register
Foundation collected data to analyze global perceptions of risk and levels of
preparedness, also, like the Global Findex, working with Gallup. Respondents were
asked to select from a list of 10 natural disasters (ranging from floods and tsunamis
to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions) the most recent type they had experienced.
In 2024, the Global Findex survey introduced a new question: “In the past three
years, have you personally experienced a natural disaster or severe weather event,
such as [insert local examples of natural disasters]?” This question reflects the top
three risks identified in the Lloyd’s Register Foundation’s 2021 report.9
One in four adults has experienced a natural disaster
The data show that 24 percent of adults in low- and middle-income economies
personally experienced a natural disaster in the three years prior to taking the
survey. East Asia and Pacific, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa have higher
average exposure rates than other regions (refer to figure S4.1.1, panel a).
Adults in the poorest 40 percent of households by income across low- and middle-
income economies were 6 percentage points more likely to experience a disaster
than those in the wealthiest 60 percent: 28 percent compared with 21 percent.
In the 10 economies with the highest share of adults saying they personally
experienced a natural disaster—Armenia, Chad, the Comoros, Madagascar, Malawi,
Morocco, Mozambique, the Philippines, Zambia, and Zimbabwe—50 percent or
more of all adults were exposed (refer to figure S4.1.1, panel b). These economies
are particularly vulnerable, and the people who live there are more likely than
average to suffer adverse consequences from a disastrous event.
For example, in Chad, which experienced severe flooding in 2022 and again in
2024,10 76 percent of people said they personally experienced a natural disaster.
In Morocco, where a 6.8 magnitude earthquake took place in 2023,11 64 percent of
adults said they were personally exposed to a disaster. Other economies in which
more than 60 percent of adults experienced a disaster include Madagascar and
Mozambique, an island and a coastal nation vulnerable to floods, respectively,
and Malawi and Zambia, neighboring nations that saw severe drought and food
shortages in 2024.12

Note: High-exposure economies are defined as those in which 50 percent or more of adults said they had been
exposed to a natural disaster or severe weather event in the past three years.
254 The Global Findex Database 2025
Within high-exposure economies, adults who are poor and those living in rural
environments tend to have higher rates of exposure to disasters. For example,
in most high-exposure economies, adults living in the poorest 40 percent of
households are between 6 percentage points (Morocco) and 15 percentage
points (Zimbabwe) more likely to be exposed to a natural disaster than those
living in the wealthiest 60 percent. The exceptions are Armenia, Madagascar,
and the Philippines, where the differences in exposure by household income are
statistically nonsignificant.
People living in rural environments in high-exposure economies are also usually
more likely than urban dwellers in those economies to experience disasters
(refer to figure S4.1.1, panel d). In Chad, Mozambique, Zambia, and Zimbabwe,
rural adults were at least 20 percentage points more likely to experience natural
disasters than urban adults. In Armenia, the difference was 16 percentage points,
and in the Comoros and Madagascar, the difference was 13 percentage points.
Rural adults in Morocco and the Philippines, on the other hand, were no more
likely than their urban counterparts to experience disasters.
Two-thirds of people exposed to natural disasters lost either
income or assets or both
People who experience a natural disaster often lose income or experience damage to
their homes or losses of livestock. Specifically, in low- and middle-income economies
in the Global Findex 2025, half of the adults who experienced a disaster lost income,
and half saw their homes damaged or lost livestock. About a third of people with
disaster exposure experienced both types of loss, so that two-thirds (67 percent) of
adults with disaster exposure experienced at least one. That translates to 13 percent
and 12 percent of all adults in low- and middle-income economies, respectively, having
suffered loss of income, damage to or loss of assets, or both, as a result of a natural
disaster.
Income loss and asset damage or loss as a share of exposed adults was higher than
the average in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa (refer to figure S4.1.2, panel a). That
this is the case in the latter region is unsurprising, given the representation of the
African continent’s economies among high-disaster economies. Differences in the
share of adults who experienced income loss or asset damage also reflect the extent
of the disaster (widespread or localized) and the quality of the building infrastructure
in the affected areas. As such, even high-exposure economies may experience
relatively low rates of income loss or asset damage (refer to figure S4.1.2, panel b),
particularly if their building codes mandate disaster-resilient construction methods or
their disaster-prone areas have relatively low population levels.

Natural disasters are more common and have bigger effects
in low-income economies
Low-income economies are more likely than middle-income economies to have
high rates of exposure to natural disasters (refer to figure S4.1.3, panel a).
Moreover, affected adults in low-income economies are more likely to experience
losses of income or damage to assets (refer to figure S4.1.3, panel b). Specifically,
35 percent of adults in low-income economies experienced a disaster, compared
with the 24 percent average across all low- and middle-income economies.
In addition, 69 percent and 72 percent of disaster-exposed adults in low-income
economies lost income or assets or had assets damaged, respectively. Middle-
income economies do not show these high rates of negative effects.

Natural disasters, mobile connectivity, and digital financial services 257
Connectivity, ID, and digital financial services can mitigate
disaster impacts
Phone ownership, personal ID, and financial accounts cannot prevent natural
disasters, but these tools can help people mitigate the effects of disasters as part of
effective policies relating to disaster preparation and response.
Phone owners may receive more up-to-date information about an impending
disaster, including emergency messages from their governments and lockdown
or evacuation orders. Forty-two percent of all adults in low- and middle-income
economies and half of mobile phone owners say they would prefer their
governments to communicate either exclusively by text or through either text
or voice message, a preference that grows as the share of connected adults
increases. In economies in which mobile phone ownership exceeds 85 percent, for
example, 53 percent of all adults and 57 percent of phone owners prefer texts for
government communication. Among people who said they experienced a natural
disaster, about 30 percent prefer to receive government communication by text
and 34 percent by phone call. Governments should leverage texts and phone calls
to get out timely communication, as they can help people stay safe and take steps
to protect their property.
Similarly, connected individuals who use the internet may have more accurate
insights into the trajectory of a wildfire or violent storm and a better understanding
of where they can access resources. Among adults in low- and middle-income
economies who experienced a natural disaster, 81 percent have any kind of phone,
and 58 percent have a smartphone. The share of adults with a phone varies by
region, however. South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, the two regions with the
highest shares of disaster exposure, have the lowest phone ownership rates (refer
to figure S4.1.4).
Social media has also become a powerful tool for communicating during a disaster.
It can let people tell friends and family they are safe and ask for anything they
need. In the United States, during hurricanes, social media platforms have served
as a valuable two-way communication channel: governments communicate with
citizens, and citizens point out neighbors who need immediate help.13 Forty percent
of adults who experienced a natural disaster used social media in the three months
before the survey.

Having government-issued ID may also allow people who are displaced by a
disaster or whose homes and property are damaged to access government or
humanitarian resources. Research on the role of ID in displaced populations
highlights that many refugees from natural disasters have to prove who they are
and what services they are entitled to—including work privileges—outside their
home districts.14 Governments and humanitarian organizations, for their part, also
use ID to coordinate services and track who receives them—all necessary to manage
resources and maintain accountability to donor and funder groups.
Among adults in high-exposure economies, 80 percent have ID.15 Though online
digital ID that can be used to access services remotely is less common than
foundational ID cards, it is gaining attention as a tool for ID holders to use if
displaced after extreme weather events.
Digital financial services might also help make people more resilient to the impacts
of natural disasters.16 Digitally enabled accounts could equip people to receive
14 IFRC (2021).
15 ID data for Armenia and Chad have been suppressed because of possible misinterpretation of the question by
survey respondents as referring to other acceptable forms of ID that could fulfill a similar purpose. This has been
judged to be likely in these economies on account of new ID systems having been rolled out while old systems were
still in place and the possibility that administrative data from ID authorities might reflect only the new systems.
16 UNSGSA (2023).

money to cover their essential needs in the wake of a disaster, even if physical bank
branches and agent locations are forced to close. This is one of the key lessons from
the COVID-19 pandemic, during which several economies used digital channels for
government support payments.17 For example, in Brazil, the Auxílio Emergencial
(Emergency Aid) program, launched in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, leveraged
digital payments through the creation of free Poupança Social Digital (Digital Social
Savings) accounts and the use of Pix instant transfers, benefiting more than 100 million
people in nine months. Brazil and other economies embraced digital payments into
accounts to disburse support payments in part because they were faster.18
Payments from family or friends living elsewhere are also more available to people
with financial accounts and mobile phones. Research studies show that people who
can receive money into accounts, particularly mobile money accounts, are better
able to receive money from their social networks.19 These payments may come from
family or friends living within the same economy, but unaffected by the disaster,
or they may be international remittances from friends and family living in different
economies, as discussed in chapter 4.2.
Overall, 75 percent of adults affected by a natural disaster have financial
accounts. Forty-seven percent of adults have digitally enabled accounts, allowing
them to make payments using debit or credit cards or phone, potentially
enabling them to make purchases without needing access to a physical branch
or agent to withdraw cash. This is crucial, given the small share of adults who
have lost access to their accounts during a natural disaster, which is statistically
significant only in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa (refer to figure S4.1.5).
Savings can also play an important role in helping people to endure a natural
disaster. Among adults who lost income or property as a result of a disaster, a
third have formal savings. These savings are the most reliable source of money in
an emergency, making them extra important for adults at risk of experiencing a
natural disaster.
Finally, insurance policies can help protect people from the worst effects of a
natural disaster. When affordable, products such as property insurance and flood
or fire insurance can give people a lump-sum disbursement they need to rebuild or
reimburse them for the loss of an asset.

Building resilience against natural disasters can help
The connection between digital connectivity, identification, and financial inclusion
offers ways to help people mitigate the negative financial effects of natural
disasters. Making these items available to all adults in communities that are
vulnerable to natural disasters could benefit both economies and individuals.

Natural disasters, mobile connectivity, and digital financial services 263
Conclusion
The Global Findex 2025 data reflect exciting achievements in digital and financial
inclusion. The average worldwide rates of ownership of mobile phones and
financial accounts—86 percent and 79 percent, respectively—represent significant
development successes, as do the noteworthy increases in rates of formal saving
and use of digital payments. Low- and middle-income economies as distinct
geographically and economically as Brazil, China, India, Kazakhstan, Kenya, and
Mongolia now have rates of account ownership at or close to 90 percent.
In addition to these advances, the Global Findex 2025 data also reveal two
important challenges. The first is that too many adults remain either entirely
excluded from or with limited access to the digital economy and the formal financial
system. Despite high rates of mobile phone ownership, more than 850 million adults
worldwide still do not have their own phones, including 325 million women in South
Asia alone. Millions more have only basic phones, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa,
where these less-expensive devices dominate. This limits these people’s ability to
participate fully in the digital economy, including to earn income through apps or
on digital platforms. And even though device cost dominates as a barrier to phone
ownership, free phones may not be the solution. Nor would they address secondary
barriers like data costs, illiteracy, and community disapproval of phone ownership
that play a role in some economies. Increasing connectivity, in other words, will
require holistic attention to device access, network infrastructure, digital literacy,
and possibly community norms.
Furthermore, although half of the 1.3 billion adults without financial accounts are
concentrated in a relatively small number of economies, these economies all have
distinct economic and regulatory environments. As such, the approaches that may
work to reach those without accounts in large-population, upper-middle-income
economies like China and India—with their high average rates of financial inclusion
enabled by strong technical infrastructure and diverse banking sectors—are likely
to be very different from what will work in any of the two dozen smaller economies
with rates of financial inclusion below 50 percent.
New strategies will also be needed to reach the 6 percent of adults globally—
or 30 percent of adults without accounts—who have neither accounts nor
265
mobile phones, given their limited access to the most promising channel for
financial inclusion available today. Helping those who have accounts, but engage
in only limited activity involving them, transition from informal financial services to
formal alternatives will also require distinct approaches. Supportive financial sector
infrastructure, such as interoperable fast payment systems, and regulations, such
as consumer protection frameworks, could help strengthen future initiatives for
financial inclusion.
The second challenge relates to financial health. Even with promising growth in
financial access and use, many people still struggle to meet their everyday needs,
handle unexpected medical bills, and plan for the future. The data on financial
resilience are important to understand, especially the finding that people’s
perceptions of their ability to manage financial shocks has not improved over the
past three years. By extension, the challenges they highlight are crucial to address.
For some, these challenges stem from a lack of income or savings. Overall, they
point to a need to focus on helping people build both short-term stability and
long-term security.
Opportunities to improve financial health may grow over time, as mobile phone
penetration continues to advance. This expansion might allow digital financial
services to reach more of the world’s adults without accounts and enable more
account owners to expand their use of digital payments, formal saving, formal
borrowing, and, where available, insurance. Such improvements could be faster
and more inclusive, however, if governments, advocates, and providers of
financial services took coordinated action. Aligning and strengthening regulations,
consumer protection, product design, and support for delivery channels with
people’s needs and challenges could help ensure that financial systems are more
effective in bolstering inclusive economic participation and improving long-term
financial health.

APPENDIX A
Survey methodology
The indicators in the Global Findex Database 2025 are drawn from survey data
covering more than 140,000 people in 141 economies, representing 96 percent
of the world’s population (refer to table A.1 for a list of the economies included).
The survey was carried out over the 2024 calendar year by Gallup, Inc., as part
of its Gallup World Poll, which since 2005 has annually conducted surveys of
approximately 1,000 people in each of more than 160 economies and in more
than 150 languages, using randomly selected, nationally representative samples.
The target population is the entire noninstitutionalized civilian population ages
15 and up.
Interview procedure
In most low- and middle-income economies, Global Findex data were collected
through face-to-face interviews. In these economies, an area frame design1 was
used for interviewing. In most high-income economies, telephone surveys were
used (refer to table A.1 for detailed information on surveying in each economy).
In 2024, face-to-face interviews were again conducted in 22 economies after phone-
based surveys had been employed in 2021 as a result of mobility restrictions related
to COVID-19. In addition, an abridged form of the questionnaire was administered
by phone to survey participants in Algeria, China, the Islamic Republic of Iran,
Libya, Mauritius, and Ukraine because of economy-specific restrictions. In just
one economy, Singapore, did the interviewing mode change from face to face
in 2021 to phone based in 2024 (refer to map A.1 for all changes in survey mode
between 2021 and 2024).
1 An area frame design is a sampling method that divides land into nonoverlapping segments using visible
boundaries, such as roads or streams. These segments are then used to select samples for data collection,
to ensure comprehensive and unbiased estimates.

Note: A phone-based survey was used in Singapore in 2024, a switch from the face-to-face survey that was
used there in 2021. In 2024, China was surveyed using both phone and web-based surveys, and Nicaragua
was surveyed using both phone and face-to-face surveys. Bahrain, Kuwait, Libya, and Oman were not
surveyed in 2021, but phone-based surveys were continued there in 2024; this was the same mode as was
employed the last time they were surveyed. Belize, Montenegro, and Trinidad and Tobago were also not
surveyed in 2021, but face-to-face surveys continued there in 2024, the same mode as the last time they
were surveyed.
In economies in which face-to-face surveys were conducted, the first stage of
sampling was the identification of primary sampling units. These units were then
stratified by population size, geography, or both and clustered through one or more
stages of sampling. Where population information was available, sample selection
was based on probabilities proportional to population size; otherwise, simple
random sampling was used. Random route procedures were used to select sampled
households. Unless an outright refusal occurred, interviewers made up to three
attempts to survey each sampled household. To increase the probability of contact
and completion, attempts were made at different times of the day and, where
possible, on different days. If an interview could not be completed at a household
that was initially part of the sample, a simple substitution method was used to select
a replacement household for inclusion.
Respondents were randomly selected within sampled households. Each eligible
household member (that is, all those ages 15 or older) was listed, and a handheld
268 The Global Findex Database 2025
survey device randomly selected the household member to be interviewed.
For paper surveys, the Kish grid method was used to select the respondent.2
In economies in which cultural restrictions dictated gender matching, respondents
were randomly selected from among all eligible adults of the interviewer’s gender.
In economies in which Global Findex surveys have traditionally been phone based,
respondent selection followed the same procedure as in previous years, using
random digit dialing or a nationally representative list of phone numbers. In most
economies in which mobile phone and landline penetration is high, a dual sampling
frame was used.
The same procedure for respondent selection was applied to economies in which
phone-based interviews were being conducted for the first time. Dual-frame
(landline and mobile phone) random digit dialing was used where landline presence
and use are 20 percent or higher based on historical Gallup estimates. Mobile phone
random digit dialing was used in economies with limited or no landline presence
(less than 20 percent).
For landline respondents in economies in which mobile phone or landline
penetration is 80 percent or higher, respondents were selected randomly by using
either the next-birthday method or the household enumeration method, which
involves listing all eligible household members and randomly selecting one to
participate. For mobile phone respondents in these economies or in economies
in which mobile phone or landline penetration is less than 80 percent, no further
selection was performed. At least three attempts were made to reach the randomly
selected person in each household, spread over different days and times of day.
Data preparation
Data weighting was used to ensure a nationally representative sample for each
economy. Final weights consisted of a base sampling weight, which corrects for
unequal probability of selection based on household size, and a poststratification
2 A Kish grid is a table of numbers used to select an interviewee. In the Global Findex surveys, the interviewer first
listed the name, gender, and age of all permanent household members ages 15 and older, whether or not they
were present, ordering them from oldest to youngest. Each eligible household member was then assigned a
number: 1 for the oldest, 2 for the second-oldest, and so on (to allow for random selection using the Kish grid).
Second, the interviewer found the appropriate cell in the Kish grid by identifying the column corresponding to
the last digit of the unique serial number assigned to the household’s questionnaire and the row corresponding
to the number of eligible household members. The number in the intersecting cell was then matched to the
assigned household numbers to determine which individual in the household would be interviewed.

weight, which corrects for sampling and nonresponse error. Poststratification
weights use economy-level population statistics on gender and age and, where
reliable data are available, education or socioeconomic status. Table A.1 shows the
data collection period, number of interviews, approximate design effect, and margin
of error for each economy, as well as sampling details where relevant.

a. Regions exclude high-income (HI) economies, and the composition of economies included in each region, as well as the region in which any particular economy is
classified, may differ from common geographic usage.
b. All data collection dates are 2024, except where noted otherwise.
c. The design effect calculation reflects weights used and does not incorporate intraclass correlation coefficients. Design effect calculation: n*(sum of squared weights)/
[(sum of weights)*(sum of weights)].
d. The margin of error was calculated around a proportion at the 95 percent confidence level. The maximum margin of error was calculated assuming a reported
percentage of 50 percent and takes into account the design effect (DE). Margin of error calculation: √(0.25/n)*1.96*√(DE). Other errors that can affect survey validity
include measurement error associated with the survey questionnaire, such as translation issues, and coverage error, which results from the fact that a part of a target
population has a zero probability of being selected for the survey.
e. Samples are nationally representative unless noted otherwise.

Environmental Benefits Statement
The World Bank Group is committed to reducing its environmen-
tal footprint. In support of this commitment, we leverage electro-
nic publishing options and print-on-demand technology, which
is located in regional hubs worldwide. Together, these initiatives
enable print runs to be lowered and shipping distances decreased,
resulting in reduced paper consumption, chemical use, greenhouse
gas emissions, and waste.
We follow the recommended standards for paper use set by the
Green Press Initiative. The majority of our books are printed on
Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)–certified paper, with nearly all
containing 50–100 percent recycled content. The recycled fiber
in our book paper is either unbleached or bleached using totally
chlorine-free (TCF), processed chlorine–free (PCF), or enhanced
elemental chlorine–free (EECF) processes.

The Global Findex 2025 reveals how mobile technology is equipping more adults around the world
to own and use financial accounts to save formally, access credit, make and receive digital payments,
and pursue opportunities. Including the inaugural Global Findex Digital Connectivity Tracker,
this fifth edition of Global Findex presents new insights on the interactions among mobile phone
ownership, internet use, and financial inclusion.
The Global Findex is the world’s most comprehensive database on digital and financial inclusion.
It is also the only global source of comparable demand-side data, allowing cross-country analysis
of how adults access and use mobile phones, the internet, and financial accounts to reach digital
information and resources, save, borrow, make payments, and manage their financial health.
Data for the Global Findex 2025 were collected from nationally representative surveys of about
145,000 adults in 141 economies. The latest edition follows the 2011, 2014, 2017, and 2021
editions and includes new series measuring mobile phone ownership and internet use, digital
safety, and frequency of transactions using financial services.
The Global Findex 2025 is an indispensable resource for policy makers in the fields of digital connectivity
and financial inclusion, as well as for practitioners, researchers, and development professionals.
